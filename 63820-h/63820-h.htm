</div>

<p>The First Alabama Regiment of Infantry was organized
under the Act of the Legislature authorizing the enlistment
of troops for twelve months. Three companies were raised
in Barbour county by Capts. Alpheus Baker, John Clark and
Jere. Williams; two in Pike, by Capts. Augustus Owen and
Dawson; one in Wilcox, by Capt. I. G. W. Steadman; one
in Tallapoosa, by Capt. J. D. Meadows; one in Talladega,
by Capt. L. F. Johnson; one in Lowndes, by Capt. J. D.
Conyers; and one in Mobile, by Capt. Ben. Lane Posey.
The companies were ordered to rendezvous at Pensacola, for
the purpose of relieving the independent companies at that
time occupying the captured forts, Barrancas and McRae, and
the navy yard. About February 10, 1861, the first companies
arrived at Pensacola, and the others rapidly followed. It was
not until April that the regimental organization was completed,
by the election and appointment of the following officers:
Colonel, Henry D. Clayton; Lieutenant-colonel, I. G. W.
Steadman; Major, Jere. Williams; Quartermaster, Capt. L.
F. Johnson; Commissary, Capt. Henry Shorter; Adjutant,
S. H. Dent; Surgeon, J. D. Caldwell, M. D.; Assistant-Surgeon,
Walter Curry, M. D.</p>

<p>Soon after its organization, by Act of the State Legislature,
but with its own consent, the regiment was mustered into the
service of the Confederate States, and was assigned to duty in
Fort Barrancas and the heavy batteries along the shore of the
bay. Many of these batteries were thrown up by the men of
the First Alabama, who, thus early in the war, were accustomed
to the use of entrenching tools. Military instruction
was not neglected; and, while industriously wielding pick
and shovel, the men were thoroughly drilled, both as heavy
artillery and infantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>A portion of the regiment was engaged in the fight on Santa
Rosa Island, and then the whole regiment served in the batteries
during the bombardments of the 23d of November, 1861, and
the 1st of January, 1862. For its gallantry on these occasions
it received complimentary mention in Gen. Bragg’s orders.</p>

<p>At the close of twelve months’ service, the regiment was
called upon to re-enlist for the war, and seven companies
promptly responded. Capts. Baker’s, Clark’s and Posey’s
companies were mustered out, and were replaced by Capt.
Knowles’ company, from Macon county; Capt. William
Pruitt’s, from Barbour; and Capt. J. F. Whitfield’s, from
Autauga. The regiment was reorganized by the election of
the following officers; Colonel, I. G. W. Steadman; Lieutenant-colonel,
M. B. Locke; Major, S. L. Knox; Adjutant,
S. D. Steadman; Quartermaster, Capt. Duncan Carmichael;
Surgeon, Dr. Schackelford (afterwards succeeded by Dr.
Hamilton). The companies were commanded respectively as
follows: Co. A, Capt. J. D. Meadows; Co. B, Capt. Ramsey;
Co. C, Capt. Stubbs; Co. D, Capt. R. H. Isbell; Co.
E, Capt. Woods; Co. F, Capt. Williams; Co. G, Capt.
Riley; Co. H, Capt. Knowles; Co. I, Capt. William Pruitt;
Co. K, Capt. John F. Whitfield.</p>

<p>In the following pages will be found a sketch of the services
of Co. K, of Autauga county. Although the author makes no
higher pretence than to be a company historian, yet he has
embodied in the story all the facts connected with the history
of the other companies, and of the regiment as a whole, that
were in his possession. From the day that Co. K joined the
regiment, in March, 1862, until the surrender of Gen. Joseph
E. Johnston, it shared in all the toils, privations and dangers
of the gallant “First,” and its history is indissolubly blended
with it. Therefore, with the kindest feelings, the writer dedicates
this little work, not only to the members of Co. K, but
to all his comrades in the</p>

<p class="hanging allsmcap">ORGANIZATION OF THE JOHN GILL SHORTER ARTILLERY—CHANGE
OF DESTINATION—AT ISLAND 10—ROLL OF
COMPANY K—MYSTERIES OF THE CUISINE—A SHAMEFUL
WASTE.</p>

</div>

<p>In February, 1862, John F. Whitfield, Esq., obtained
the authority to recruit one of the three companies necessary
to complete the reorganization of the First Alabama
Regiment, C. S. A., serving at that time as heavy artillery
at Pensacola, Fla. Meeting with Merrill E. Pratt, Esq.,
of Prattville, he proposed to that gentleman to raise one-half
the company, he himself expecting to bring thirty
or forty men into the field. Mr. Pratt was thinking, at
this time, of joining another regiment with a small squad
of men, who desired to be with him in the army, but,
seeing now a wider field for usefulness, he accepted the
proposal. In a few days, through his personal influence
and popularity, he enrolled the names of nearly fifty volunteers,
including some of the best men in Autauga county,
and, had he not been restricted by the terms of his agreement
with Capt. Whitfield, he could, without difficulty,
have recruited a full company. On the 7th of March,
Lieut. Pratt and his men proceeded to Montgomery, and,
on the following day, were mustered into the service of
the Confederacy, styling themselves, in honor of the Governor
of the State, the “John Gill Shorter Artillery.”
John F. Whitfield was elected Captain; M. E. Pratt,
First Lieutenant; Dixon S. Hall, Second Lieutenant, Jr.;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
and Charles E. Tuttle, Orderly Sergeant. The second lieutenancy
was left vacant, to be filled by the squad of men
Capt. Whitfield still expected to secure. For the failure
of these men to report, Capt. Whitfield was in no manner
responsible, he acting throughout in good faith. No
officer had more the confidence and affection of his men
than Capt. Whitfield, and this esteem he retained from
first to last.</p>

<p>While in Montgomery, enameled cloth knapsacks and
haversacks, and cedar canteens, were issued to the men,
but they provided their own uniforms, no two of which
were alike.</p>

<p>When enrolled the men expected to go to Pensacola,
but upon arriving in Montgomery, it was learned that the
regiment had left that place for New Madrid, Mo., a fortified
post on the Mississippi River. As this change in
destination, from a warm to a cold climate, and from garrison
to field duty, necessitated a change in clothing,
leave of absence for two days was given the members
of the company to return home and make needed preparations.
There was a general cutting down in the amount
of <i>impedimenta</i>, though most of the men loaded themselves
with twice the amount that could be carried on a
march.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 10th, the company reassembled
in Montgomery, and, under the command of Lieut.
Hall, started for Memphis. Monday night they camped
at Atlanta, not being able to proceed farther on account
of the crowded trains. It was not till Wednesday noon
that the company reached Memphis. The regiment was
just leaving the city by the boat, and could not wait for
the company to join; Lieut. Hall, however, reported, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
received orders to proceed by the steamer “Republic,”
which left the next day at 5 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Thursday night the
boat reached Fort Pillow, where it was learned that New
Madrid had been evacuated, and that the First Alabama
had been ordered to Island No. 10. Friday evening the
“Republic” arrived at Tiptonville, and the men disembarked;
but, the boat being detained, they slept on board
that night. Saturday they again landed, and marched
across from Tiptonville to Island No. 10, a distance of
six miles. The regiment was found encamped without
tents in a newly-cleared field, and the company, thus
early in its service, began roughing it. It was not till
the 18th that they received any tents; they then were
moved into a wood, some three-quarters of a mile from
the river. On the 25th the camp was again moved, and
tents pitched in regulation order in an open field in the
rear of Batteries Nos. 5 and 6; a camp guard was detailed,
and the military routine of guard-mounting, drill
and dress-parade began.</p>

<p>Capt. Whitfield and Lieut. Pratt arrived on the 18th,
receiving a hearty welcome. There now being no hope
of the other squad reporting, it was decided that Lieut.
Pratt should return home and recruit the company to its
full strength.</p>

<p>Lieut. Dixon S. Hall was promoted to the second
lieutenancy, and Orderly Sergt. C. E. Tuttle, who
had ably performed his duties and looked after the
comfort of the men, was made junior second lieutenant.
The following is the roll of the company, as it stood at
that time:—</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Captain</i>, John F. Whitfield.</li>
<li><i>First Lieutenant</i>, Merrill E. Pratt.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></li>

</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>Total, 4 commissioned officers, 9 non-commissioned
officers and 39 privates.</p>

<p>W. H. Hutchinson was soon after detailed as a member
of the drum corps, and O. M. Blaylock was appointed
corporal in his stead. Joseph Hurd was detailed at the
same time as fifer. All the above were present for duty,
except Private Griffin, who received a furlough when he
enlisted, and reported to Capt. Isbell after the surrender
of the Island. Muskets were not issued to Co. K for
two weeks after their arrival, but details for fatigue and
guard duty were made after a few days. When Capt.
Rucker’s company was relieved at Battery No. 1, on the
third or fourth day of the siege, a detail of sixty men
from the First Alabama was ordered there, with daily
relief. Co. K furnished four or five men of this detail.</p>

<p>The men were quickly initiated into the mysteries of
the <i>cuisine</i>, and from the first day some were quite good
cooks, while others made most amusing blunders. A
camp-kettle, half full of rice, was a source of much worry
to an amateur who attempted to boil it—there were not
enough utensils in the company to hold South Carolina’s
favorite dish as it swelled in the pot. Commissary stores
were plentiful, and there was a shameful waste. Fresh
beef was hauled off and buried by the wagon load; barrels
of corned beef remained untouched in the camp;
while rice, flour, molasses and sugar were issued in larger
quantities than could possibly be eaten. These were the
last days of the “Flush times of the First Alabama.”</p>

<p>On the 30th of March, Lieut. Pratt and Corp. Ellis
left for Alabama to enlist recruits. About the same time
Privates M. A. Smith and J. L. Robinson were honorably
discharged on account of physical disability, and left for
their homes.</p>

<p class="hanging allsmcap">BOMBARDMENT AND CAPTURE OF ISLAND NO. 10—THE
BATTERIES—AT RUCKER’S BATTERY—CANAL CUTTING—A
NIGHT ATTACK—RUNNING THE GAUNTLET—AN
UNFINISHED MEAL—THE ATTEMPTED EVACUATION—RETREAT
TO TIPTONVILLE—MACKALL’S ORDER—THE
SURRENDER—ACROSS REEL-FOOT RIVER.</p>

</div>

<p>Island No. 10 is, or was, in the Mississippi River, opposite
the boundary-line between Kentucky and Tennessee.
The river approaches the island in nearly a southerly
direction, then runs to the northwest about twelve miles
to New Madrid, where it makes a semi-circular sweep, and
takes its course to the southeast for sixteen miles to Tiptonville,
Tenn., forming a great horseshoe bend of six
miles in width, and opening to the southeast. Across
this opening, a few miles to the eastward, is Reel-Foot
River or bayou, emptying into the Mississippi below Tiptonville;
in high water expanding into a lake, and connecting
with the Mississippi above Island No. 10, cutting
off all approach except by boats.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the bombardment, Gen. McCown
was in command of the Confederate forces, augmented,
by the evacuation of New Madrid, to some ten or twelve
thousand men. More than half these troops were,
however, withdrawn about the last of March. The
batteries, which had been ably planned, but imperfectly
constructed, under direction of Capt. Harris, of the Engineer
Corps, contained forty-four guns, mostly 32 and
42 pound smooth-bores, with a few 64-pounders and one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
or two 100-pound rifles. Twenty-seven guns, not mounted,
were scattered along the river bank and on the Island.
The batteries were distributed as follows: On the Tennessee
bank of the river were six—No. 1 (Rucker’s), six
guns; No. 2, four guns; No. 3, three guns; No. 4, four
guns; No. 5, two guns; No. 6, seven guns; total, twenty-seven.
On the Island were four batteries—No. 1, six
guns; No. 2, four guns; No. 3, five guns; No. 4, two
guns; total, seventeen. A floating battery—the old
Algiers floating dock—was moored to the left bank of
the Island; and on the deck of this nondescript craft,
wholly unprotected, were eight guns.</p>

<p>The enemy, upon the evacuation of New Madrid, established
batteries there and soon after at Point Pleasant,
opposite Tiptonville—thus cutting off approach to the
island by river. Boats made a landing at Tiptonville
and—when it became too warm there—at a point just
below, and thus communication was kept up till the gunboats
ran the Island 10 batteries, a few days before the
surrender.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 15th the Federal fleet arrived
from above, and opened fire upon the Confederate works.
There were seven iron-clads: the “Benton,” “Louisville,”
“Carondelet,” “Conestoga,” “Pittsburgh,” “St. Louis” and
“Mound City,” armed with ten heavy guns each, and eight
mortar-boats, each carrying one thirteen-inch mortar.
Their fire concentrated on Rucker’s and the Island batteries,
was continued all day and slowly on Sunday, the
16th. Monday morning the iron-clads, lashed three together,
dropped down the river, stern foremost, to within
a mile and a half of Rucker’s Battery and anchored.
They maintained a heavy fire all day, throwing, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
mortar fleet, 1,350 shot and shell, of which 1,000 were
hurled at Capt. Rucker’s guns and 350 at the Island.
There was no one hurt on the Island, though there were
many narrow escapes. At Battery No. 1, on the main
land, a shot passed through the parapet, dismounting a
gun, killing Lieut. Clark, of Capt. Rucker’s company,
and wounding several men. These were the only casualties
during the siege.</p>

<p>Elcon Jones, of the Signal Corps, was stationed at
Rucker’s Battery. During the day his signal-flag was
twice shot from his hand. In one instance he was transmitting
a message, and he picked up the flag and continued
his communication without missing a word. He
was afterwards complimented in general orders by Gen.
Beauregard and promoted.</p>

<p>The Confederate artillery practice was very good; the
iron-clads were repeatedly hit, and before night they
hauled off, continuing their fire with their long-range
rifles. One shot struck the “Benton,” passed through her
iron-clad side into the Captain’s cabin, bounded from the
floor to the ceiling and landed on the table. The dismounted
gun at Battery 1 was placed in position again
that night, not having been seriously damaged.</p>

<p>Tuesday the bombardment was resumed, but the fleet
did not come within good range of the Confederate
smooth-bores, and our fire was, in consequence, slack.
Capt. Rucker’s company, exhausted by its severe labors,
was relieved by the First Alabama. The river continuing
to rise, the working of the guns in Battery No. 1
was rendered difficult, if not impossible, by the water,
which was two feet deep on the platforms. All the powder
and shell had to be removed from the magazine, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
without other protection than a tarpaulin, stowed in an
angle of the breastworks. On rainy days some of the
guards would creep under the tarpaulin, propping it up
with a handspike so as to get air; but this improvised
tent would invariably attract the enemy’s attention, and a
shell would go shrieking over, causing the hasty striking
of the shelter. A deep slough connecting with Reel-Foot
Bayou cut off all approach to this battery except
in boats, and as the relief details had to be sent up after
dark, a trip on stormy nights was attended with some
risk. On one occasion a boat was carried by the swift
current into the swamp and capsized; the crew were not
rescued till daylight—passing the night, cold and wet, on
stumps or driftwood.</p>

<p>In the meantime the enemy’s engineers were clearing
a channel, or canal, through the swamps and bayous on
the west side of the river, from a point above the Island
to one below, to enable them to get small transports
below the batteries and to transport troops across the
river and take the Confederates in the rear. But little
digging was required, as the high stage of the river gave
the necessary depth of water; but the trees had to be cut
out of the way. The trees were felled, leaving the stumps
just above the water. A cross-cut saw, forming the lower
side of a triangular frame, was then pivoted by the upper
angle to the stump, so as to swing freely—the blade of
the saw being four feet below the surface of the water.
Twenty men on a side operating this simple device could
cut off a stump two feet in diameter in a few minutes.
The canal was completed early in April, and several
transports were at once sent through, arriving safely at
New Madrid. As the gunboats were of too deep draught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to use the canal, preparations were at once made to run
one of them by the batteries, and, as a preliminary step,
it was decided to spike the guns in the dangerous upper
battery.</p>

<p>On the night of April 1st five boats were made ready
with crews from the gunboats “Cincinnati,” “St. Louis,”
“Benton,” “Pittsburgh” and “Mound City,” and volunteers
from the Forty-Third Illinois Infantry, all under command
of Col. Roberts. In each boat were twenty men, exclusive
of officers. Every precaution was taken to insure secrecy;
the oar-locks were muffled, and the expedition did
not start till midnight, when all was quiet. The night
was dark and stormy, and the only difficulty was in finding
the battery; but a flash of lightning revealed its
position as they got abreast, and a landing was effected
without opposition. But two sentinels were on the battery;
these fired their guns and ran back to the main
guard, who were on the parapet of the breastwork in the
rear. By the time the alarm was fairly given the enemy
had spiked the guns and re-embarked. The successful
termination of this attack was due largely to the fact that
the battery being submerged except the parapet, there
was no place for the guard immediately around the guns,
though there was, undoubtedly, carelessness in not having
more men on duty. A boat was despatched to camp
with the alarm, and a fresh detachment of men was sent
up. Co. K, prior to this event, had received no arms,
but during the alarm a lot of old muskets and ten rounds
of cartridges were distributed. Two of the guns were
unspiked during the nights of the 2d and 3d.</p>

<p>The night of April 4th set in dark and threatening;
in the midst of a terrific thunder-storm the long-roll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
sounded, and the battalion was hastily formed in line of
battle in the rear of the batteries. Mingled with the
almost continuous roll of the thunder was the roar of a
heavy cannonade, while the lightning and the flashes of the
guns, rendered more vivid by the intense darkness of the
night, combined to render it a scene of wonderful grandeur.
The firing continued but for a brief period, and quiet being
restored, the men were dismissed to their quarters.</p>

<p>In the morning it was ascertained that the iron-clad
“Carondelet,” protected by barges of baled hay, had successfully
run the batteries. She was first discovered by
the sentinels at Rucker’s Battery, who fired their muskets,
giving the alarm. An attempt was made to use the
two guns which had been unspiked, but the charges were
damp, not having been drawn after the guns were unspiked,
and they could not be fired.</p>

<p>During the 5th the fleet shelled the camp of the First
Alabama and other regiments, but no one was hurt.
The following night the enemy crossed a small force
opposite New Madrid, and spiked the batteries of light
artillery stationed there, but immediately retired.</p>

<p>Sunday, the 6th of April, was clear and pleasant, and
passed quietly. At dress-parade the troops were ordered
to be in readiness to march at the sounding of the long-roll.
The signal came while the men were preparing or
eating supper, and leaving everything—the tents standing,
cooking utensils scattered around, in some cases the
food half cooked in the kettles—the battalion of the First
Alabama in camp, numbering about 325 men, formed on
the parade-ground and marched to the general headquarters.
About 350 of the regiment stationed on the Island,
60 at Battery No. 1 and a considerable number sick in
camp were left behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>The commander of the forces at this time was Gen.
Mackall, Gen. McCown having been relieved April 1st.
It was dark when the troops, about fifteen hundred in
number, left headquarters, the First Alabama in the advance.
After marching ten miles, the column was halted
in the woods, and formed in line of battle about half a
mile from the river and nearly opposite New Madrid. It
soon began to rain, and as fires were not permitted, the
condition of affairs was anything but pleasant. The
object of the move was, ostensibly, to prevent a landing
of the enemy, crossing from New Madrid. The night,
however, passed without alarm, except a slight stir caused
by pickets bringing in a prisoner. A heavy cannonade
in the direction of Island No. 10 announced that another
iron-clad had stolen by in the darkness. This vessel, it
was afterwards learned, was the “Pittsburgh;” she was
protected in the same way as the “Carondelet,” and received
no injury. Daybreak found the men cold, wet
and hungry, many of them having eaten no supper.
The wagons arrived about 7 o’clock; flour, bacon and
cooking utensils were issued to the companies, and an
attempt was made to prepare breakfast; but orders to
resume the march compelled the men to leave the half-cooked
meal on the coals. Information had been received
that the Federal troops were crossing lower down
the river, and that the garrison was in danger of being
cut off. Many of the troops were unaccustomed to
marching, and upon leaving camp had overburdened
themselves with baggage. As a consequence, the road
along which the men were hurried was strewn with every
kind and description of apparel and not a few blankets.
It was nearly dark when the command approached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Tiptonville, and, making a detour, passed around and below
it. That landing was already in possession of the enemy,
and a force of their cavalry were following close in the
rear of the retreating Confederates, picking up stragglers.
While opposite Tiptonville there was an alarm, and the
column was halted and brought to a front; but no attack
was made, and the march was resumed. About three-quarters
of a mile below Tiptonville the command was
formed in line of battle, and there remained all night, the
men sleeping in ranks, with their arms by their sides.
Gens. Gantt and Walker, who had been stationed opposite
New Madrid, had retired with our command, and the
combined force numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 men.</p>

<p>At 11 o’clock, Monday night, Gen. Mackall arranged
terms for the surrender of his army, but the soldiers were
not made aware of it until the next morning, otherwise
many would have made their escape. The universal feeling
among men and officers was, that the surrender was
utterly uncalled for, and that the greater portion of the
force could have been safely taken out while a few men
held Gen. Pope’s army in check. Many denounced Gen.
Mackall as a traitor, and asserted that the surrender had
been arranged several days before. While this report
was wholly without foundation, yet of his incapacity no
one who was present could have any doubt. Gen.
McCown was removed by Gen. Beauregard because,
after the fall of New Madrid, he had pronounced the
position at Island No. 10 untenable, and Gen. Mackall
was ordered there, with instructions to hold it at all
hazards until further orders. On the morning after the
gunboat “Carondelet” passed the batteries, he issued the
following address to the troops:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Gen. Beauregard, in a communication published since
the close of the war, expressed himself as satisfied with
Gen. Mackall’s performance of the trust, but his troops
saw only a series of blunders.</p>

<p>Gen. Mackall surrendered 3,000 men, 4,000 stand of
arms, 75 siege guns and 24 pieces of light artillery.
The enemy captured four transports afloat, and two transports
and the gunboat “Grampus” which had been
scuttled, and a considerable amount of stores and ammunition.</p>

<p>The following are the members of Co. K who were
surrendered at Tiptonville: Capt. J. F. Whitfield, Lieut.
D. S. Hall, Lieut. C. E. Tuttle, Sergts. Thompson, Rodgers,
Merritt and Sears, Corps. Williamson and Blaylock,
Privates Adams, Bledsoe, C. W. Brown, Cook, Dennis,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Farmer, Frank, Fay, Hurd, Killough, May, C. H. Royals,
Rice, Roe, D. P. Smith, J. S. Tunnell and Josiah Tunnell;
total, 3 officers and 23 enlisted men. The commissioned
officers were sent to Columbus, Ohio, and afterwards
transferred to Johnson’s Island; the enlisted
men were sent to Camp Butler, near Springfield, Ill.
Several of the company were sick, and, with their attendants,
were taken prisoners at the camp or in the
hospital, viz.: Privates A. P. Brown, E. F. Brown, Fergerson,
J. C. Hearn, Hearndon, C. J. Moncrief, W. L.
Moncrief, J. F. Smith and Tarleton; total, 9. These were
sent to Madison, Wis., and afterwards transferred to
Camp Douglas, Chicago, Ill. J. F. Smith, mentioned
above, started from the Island 10 camp with the company,
but was attacked with measles, and was sent back
to the hospital. Several hundred of the troops escaped
across Reel-Foot River by wading and by boats. Among
these were the following members of Co. K: Sergt.
Norman Cameron, Corp. J. M. Royals, Privates Averheart,
Durden, Hancock, Hutchinson, Elijah Hearn,
George Hearn, Holston, Junius Robinson, G. H. Royals
and Wilkins; total, 12. Some of these were on detail
at Battery 1 and elsewhere, and others were on the sick-list
when the company left camp.</p>

<p>The companies of the First Alabama stationed at the

</div>

<p>At daybreak on Tuesday, April 8th, the retreating
garrison were quietly aroused from their leafy, but not
otherwise romantic, couches in the woods below Tiptonville.
It was a cold, cloudy morning, and the men, who
had been without food or fire for twenty-four hours, stood
impatiently in line of battle eager for something to be
done that would warm up their chilled limbs and bodies.
To continue the retreat, or to fight either would have
been a welcome change, but the order that was passed
down the lines was received almost in a spirit of mutiny
by both officers and men. All knew that “Do not fire
on the enemy” could mean nothing but surrender. Rations
were served out, cooking utensils distributed, and
fires built; but while busy cooking the men were ordered
to “fall in,” “stack arms” and “march,” and breakfast was
abandoned or eaten half raw. Upon arriving at Tiptonville
the surrendered army was formed in close column,
in an open field, and surrounded by guards. The field had
been cultivated in corn, the previous year, and though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the hollows between the rows might in dry weather,
have offered rather tempting couches, they were treacherous
ones in a wet season, while the black swamp mud
was not conducive to cleanliness. During the day flour
and bacon were served out, and the men had plenty of
time to cook and eat. With night came on a storm, and
the prisoners made such shelters as they could with fence
rails and blankets. The only fuel was that offered by
fences, with the stumps of the newly cleared land for
<i>pieces de resistance</i>. Those who essayed the blanket
shelters were roused by trickling streams of water from
above, to find themselves lying in ponds of water one or
two inches deep. Sounder sleepers would not awake till
some rascal had filched their blankets, and the fire-builders
had stolen their rails. By midnight the majority of
the twenty-five hundred prisoners were packed, in circular
groups, six or seven deep, around the fires, which
dotted the field, or were wandering disconsolately from
fire to fire hoping to find some place where a gleam of
the flames could be seen. The anathemas of the men
were bestowed quite impartially upon the weather, the
Yankees and Gen. Mackall the Confederate Commander.
Words and invective were exhausted in showering curses
upon the last. Had they not been prisoners the discomforts
of the night would have been of little moment, but
under the existing circumstances it was dismal beyond
description. Day at last dawned, and the men were
almost ready to welcome with a cheer the arrival of the
transports, which were to take them away from such a
mud-hole, even though it was to a military prison. The
boats were small stern-wheelers and conveyed the men only
to New Madrid, Mo., where they were landed in the mud.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
New Madrid mud is red, contrasting well with the Tiptonville
black, and, as there was no opportunity for ablutions,
mud and smoke soon rendered the Confederates as varied
in hue as Indian braves. Abundant rations of hard tack,
bacon and coffee were served out, and, although the
storm had not ended, the situation was much more comfortable
than during the preceding twenty-four hours.
The officers were now separated from the enlisted men—something
akin in pain to parting parents from children.</p>

<p>Thursday afternoon the prisoners were again embarked,
and, under convoy, the boats steamed up the river. At
dusk the fleet passed Island 10, stopping for a short time;
the next morning Columbus was left behind, and by 10.30
<span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> a landing was made at Cairo. The prisoners were
here transferred to close box-cars, which to sight and
smell, bore evidence of having, very recently, been used
to transport cattle. A bale of hay was rolled into each
car, to serve—when spread over the floor—as seats and
bedding. To secure the safety and welfare of the passengers
one guard was placed in each car, and was not
relieved till the train reached its destination. The sentinel
in our car was an Irishman, a social, friendly fellow,
considerate of the prisoners’ feelings and reposing great
confidence in their honor, which confidence was not
abused. Probably his superiors would have been somewhat
astonished at his ideas about guard duty, which were
not those laid down in army regulations. Whenever the
train stopped, even after nightfall, he would either allow
some of the prisoners to jump out and fill their canteens,
or go himself. During the night he handed his musket
to one of the Confederates, laid down in the hay and went
to sleep. His brother, the guard in the next car got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
uproariously drunk, and about midnight came stumbling
into our car. He was so quarrelsome that we put him
out, in a few minutes he was back, this time bringing
his musket and threatening vengeance, but our slumbering
guardian being aroused quieted him with a few words,
more forcible than elegant, and sent him back to his post.
Placed under a <i>quasi</i> parole of honor by the kindness of
our Irish friend, not a prisoner attempted to escape from
his car though there was abundant opportunity. In one
village through which we passed in the night citizen’s
dress was offered to some of the men to enable them to
escape if they so desired. The train reached Camp Butler,
four miles from Springfield, Ill., Saturday afternoon,
April 12th. In the surrounding fields patches of snow
were still visible, but the camp itself was a mud-puddle.
When we left Alabama, a month previous, the fruit trees
were in blossom, planters were busy ploughing, and the
air was mild and balmy; on our arrival at Island 10 it
was cold and the trees were bare, the first signs of Spring
appearing as we left; now, for the third time, we were to
have wintry weather. There were at Camp Butler fifteen
or eighteen hundred prisoners taken at Fort Donelson,
these occupied eighteen out of the twenty barracks within
the prison lines, two being used as hospitals. The new
arrivals were ordered from the cars and marched to the
parade ground for inspection; blankets were unrolled,
knapsacks unstrapped and the persons of the prisoners
searched for concealed weapons, but no money or valuables
were taken. Some three hundred of the prisoners were
then sent to the barracks, and to the remaining six or
seven hundred were allotted tents, one to every six or
eight men, boards were distributed for floors and before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
night the men were comfortably sheltered. The barracks
were about sixty feet long by twenty wide, standing
twenty feet apart, and were intended to accommodate
one hundred men each. In front of the barracks—a street
fifty feet wide intervening—the tents were pitched. Immediately
to the rear of the line of tents was the guard
and dead line; the dead line at the ends was within a few
feet of the lines of barracks and tents and about two hundred
feet to the rear of the barracks, thus enclosing in
round numbers a parallelogram 800 feet long by 300 or
350 feet wide. As the warm weather came on, a second
line of tents was pitched in the rear of the first and the
crowded barracks relieved. The supply of water on our
arrival was drawn from five or six wells within the enclosure;
each barrack was supplied with a rope, and each
mess used its own camp-kettle for a bucket, attaching it
to the rope and drawing it up hand over hand. The
scene around the wells was a lively one, especially just
before the time for preparing meals. During the rainy
season the supply of water in the wells was tolerably
plentiful, though it would occasionally give out. By the
first of May, however, the wells began to fail, and on May
7th it is recorded in the writer’s diary: “Water is getting
to be a luxury, the wells are exhausted before sunrise.”
After that time water was hauled from Sangamon river—about
a mile distant—details of prisoners going with
the wagons to fill up the hogsheads and barrels. It was
esteemed a great privilege to go with the wagons as it
gave opportunity to bathe and to gather mussels in the
river. The fresh country air too was a wonderful contrast
to the stifled atmosphere of the prison camp on a hot
day. Outside the guard lines was another prison hospital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>,
set apart for erysipelas cases, of which there were
many among the prisoners. Its occupants burned in
stripes with lunar caustic and painted with iodine, were a
horribly grotesque crowd. Side by side with this hospital
was the dead house, always tenanted with bodies waiting
burial. At the head of the street, which separated
the barracks and tents, was the “headquarters” of the
Commandant of the post; at the other end of the street
was the guard house with its dreaded “black hole,” a cell
without light or ventilation. In an addition to these buildings
were the Commissary’s, Quartermaster’s and Sutler’s
stores, and the barracks for the guard.</p>

<p>When the Island No. 10 prisoners arrived the camp
was not enclosed, and there had been in consequence
many escapes. It was quite common to hear in the
morning the announcement, “A squad of prisoners left for
home last night.” As calling the roll was entrusted to
non-commissioned officers among the prisoners—there
were no commissioned officers prisoners at Camp Butler—and
as their reports were verified not oftener than once a
week, several days were usually allowed to elapse before
absentees were reported, thus giving them a fair start in
the race for the Ohio or Mississippi Rivers. As many
as nine broke through the guard lines in a single night;
nor were escapes confined to the darkness, sometimes a
break would be made in the broad daylight, and as the
cavalry patrolled the lines during the day with sabres,
the only risk was that of recapture. In one case, as the
astonished sentinel saw prisoner after prisoner flitting by,
he cried out, in accents of despair, “Corporal of the guard!
corporal of the guard! run here quick, all the rebels are
getting away!” These frequent escapes of prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
soon led to more rigorous measures. Those recaptured
were incarcerated in the black hole for a week or ten
days; all prisoners were required to remain in their barracks
from dusk until reveille, under penalty of being
shot, and a board fence ten feet high was built around
the camp. The fence, made chiefly by volunteers from
among the prisoners, small wages being paid them, was
completed early in May, and served to check the flight
of the prisoners, though it did not prove an effectual
barrier. Not many nights after its completion, during a
storm, a party of four scaled it by aid of a short ladder
they had constructed; a flash of lightning revealed them
to the guard, who fired, but without effect. Some of the
prisoners who worked on the fence, broke short the nails
with which certain marked boards were fastened; making
a dash for the fence one day they pulled off one of these
planks, and three got through before the sentinel could
fire. Two of the three were recaptured while running the
gauntlet of a militia camp, just outside the enclosure and
did penance in the “black hole,” the third escaped. An
attempt was made to tunnel out, but it was betrayed to
Maj. Fundy, and stopped when the tunnel had nearly
reached the fence; it was started from a freshly dug sink.
Those engaged in it escaped punishment by pledging
their word not to renew the work. The cavalry regiment
guarding the camp having been relieved by ununiformed
militia, a novel plan of escape was successfully tried. A
lot of rusty muskets had been found in one of the barracks
by the Fort Donelson prisoners on their arrival,
these had been carefully concealed with a view that they
might sometime be useful. After the wells began to fail,
and before the hauling of water in wagons had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
begun, squads of prisoners were allowed to go out with
guards to neighborhood wells and fill buckets and canteens.
Procuring or fixing up costumes sufficiently like
those worn by the militia to be mistaken for them, and
brightening up the old muskets so as to pass muster,
some of the prisoners played the part of guards and
escorted out several squads who did not return. Another
scheme was successfully played on the militia, who were
very ignorant, many being unable to read. Hospital attendants
were given passes to cross and recross the guard
lines, they giving their paroles not to escape; noting carefully
those of the guards who read these passes equally well
bottom or right side up, bogus passes were prepared, no
attempt being made to imitate the writing of the Federal
officials, and the guards passed the holders out. No less
than thirty left in this manner before the imposture was detected.
None of those under parole violated their pledges,
nor were they in any way connected with the writing of the
spurious passes, but they suffered, as all passes were revoked.
The regulations were henceforth so stringent that
but few were able to elude the vigilance of the guards.
During the six months that elapsed from the arrival of the
prisoners to their departure for exchange, 225 escaped
from Camp Butler. Not all of these, however, got back to
Dixie, quite a number being recaptured and sent to other
prisons. Among those who escaped by bogus passes
was John Frank, Jr.; starting for the Mississippi River, he,
and one or two companions, lost themselves on the prairies
and, after wandering around for several days, made their
way to a farm-house, where they procured something to
eat, though they were suspected of being rebels. They
next, unfortunately, wandered into Alton, where, finding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
themselves objects of suspicion, they surrendered. Frank
rejoined us only when on our way to be exchanged. The
first tragedy under the regulation requiring the prisoners
to go into the barracks or tents at dusk, occurred on the
evening of May 2d. One of the prisoners was seated on
the steps of his barrack washing his feet, when “retreat”
sounded; a guard, standing almost beside him, ordered
him in, but the man was a little slow in complying, as
he had his feet in the water; the guard repeated the order
twice, and then fired on the prisoner, inflicting a wound
from which he died in about three weeks. The sentinel’s
conduct was approved, and he was promoted to be a corporal,
but the precaution was taken not to place him on
guard over the prisoners again, for fear of his meeting
with an “accident.”</p>

<p>On our arrival at Camp Butler the commander of the
post was Col. Morrison, a superannuated officer of the
regular army, kind hearted but very irascible. In his
conduct towards the prisoners he was generally very
lenient; soon after their arrival he had clothing and
blankets issued to those who were insufficiently clad, and
did them other favors. Towards his own men he was a
martinet. On one occasion the colonel crossed the guard
line and the sentinel failed to salute him; crossing a
second time to make sure the sentinel saw him, he halted
in front of the negligent guard, and in thundering voice
demanded: “Do you know who I am, sir?” “Yes,
sir,” was the quavering response. “Why did you not
salute me?” and without waiting for a reply, he seized
the volunteer by the collar and administered to him a
sound kicking. To the prisoners, accustomed to a perfect
equality between officers and men, this was a novel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
sight and excited various comments. To the commissary
officer of the post, a Virginian, and, it was said, a Southern
sympathizer, the prisoners were greatly indebted for
full rations and the privilege of trading any surplus for
luxuries and merchandise at very reasonable rates. He
had the reputation of being “square” in all his dealings,
and was consequently much liked.</p>

<p>On our arrival, and for sometime after, the mortality at
Camp Butler was great; up to the 25th of May there
had been 318 deaths, a rate equivalent to 56 out of every
100 per year. During the month of May Maj. Fundy,
of the Twelfth Illinois Cavalry, was given supervision of
the Camp, and, by stricter sanitary regulations, the
death rate was diminished, there being but 162 deaths
from May 25th to September 6th, a rate of about 22½
out of every 100 per year. If it be taken into consideration
that several hundred prisoners had escaped, the percentage
of deaths will be somewhat greater than stated.
Up to September 6th, the date of exchange, 225 had escaped,
leaving 2,613; the average time of imprisonment
was nearly twenty-six weeks—that is 1800 men 200 days
and 1000 men, 146 days; the total number of deaths was
480, or 18⅓ out of every 100 for the six months, or
36⅔ per 100 a year. In this connection it is but fair to
state that the provision made for the sick was ample; a
good assortment of medicines was kept in the hospital
drugstore, which, after our arrival, was placed in the charge
of Joseph Hurd, of Co. K, a competent druggist. Among
the prisoners were several surgeons, and in addition
to these, Dr. J. Cooper McKee, U. S. A., was surgeon of
the post. While he was in charge he ordered large additional
supplies of medicine, and a room was fitted up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
exclusively as a drug store. When he was relieved, the
latter part of July, a Springfield physician was placed in
charge. The nurses were volunteers from the prisoners,
among them N. K. Adams and Wm. H. Fay, of Co. K;
D. P. Smith was Mr. Hurd’s assistant.</p>

<p>To resume the company diary: On the Sunday following
our arrival it set in to storm, and on Monday there
was a heavy fall of snow, a novelty to many who witnessed
it. Spring now rapidly advanced, and by May 1st
the trees were beginning to leaf, the grass was green and
violets were in bloom. On the 23d of April there was
seen the curious phenomenon of four mock suns, the real
sun being in the centre. There was a brilliant electrical
display on May 30th; for nearly an hour the flashes of
lightning were almost incessant, but a few seconds intervening,
while at times, for several minutes together, the
play of electrical light would be absolutely without intermission.
Occasionally great nebulous balls of fire would
roll up from the horizon to the zenith, then would
follow flashes of chain and forked lightning, diverging to
every point of the heavens. No rain accompanied the
electrical storm, but during its entire continuance there
could be heard the distant low roll of thunder.</p>

<p>May 3d the camp was shocked by a tragedy in one of
the barracks occupied by Mississippians: one of the
prisoners, in a quarrel with a companion, seized a billet
of wood and struck a fatal blow. The murderer was
taken to Springfield and put in jail, but was not brought
to trial, and when the prisoners were exchanged he was
sent with the others.</p>

<p>May 9th, Thomas G. Roe (private, Co. K) died of
measles. This was the first death in our company, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
caused sincere sorrow. On the following day he was
buried in the prisoners’ graveyard, near the camp. Col.
Morrison kindly permitted the company to accompany
the body to the grave. William H. Fay read a chapter
in the Bible and made a prayer. The grave was marked
with a headboard inscribed with the name, company and
regiment of the deceased.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of May 14th, A. J. Merritt (sergeant,
Co. K) died of measles. Both he and Mr. Roe
were sick from the time of our arrival. Mr. Merritt
refused to give up, and remained in his tent till within a
day or two of his death, when he became so weak as to
be forced to go to the hospital. He was much depressed
from leaving home and family, but both he and Mr. Roe
died very peacefully.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 7th, John N. Cook (private,
Co. K) died, and was buried the same day, the company
receiving permission to attend. This was the last death
in Co. K at Camp Butler.</p>

<p>On the 22d of June, Col. Fundy succeeded Col. Morrison
as commander of the post. He was much less of
a martinet, and was also popular with the prisoners in
consequence of his showing them some favors. Occasionally
through the summer he allowed the prisoners—several
hundred at a time—to go to the river to bathe,
under guard and an implied parole not to escape. The
prisoners never, to the writer’s knowledge, abused his
confidence. He would listen to complaints, and, if well
founded, would remedy the evil. At one time the militia—or,
more properly, the recruits in an adjoining camp
of instruction—made a practice of firing their muskets,
loaded with ball, in such a direction that the balls fell in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
the prison enclosure. The whizzing of lead became a
sound of daily occurrence, but the prisoners stood it
very patiently till one of their number was struck and
seriously wounded. A committee was then sent to Col.
Fundy, to remonstrate and to plainly intimate that if the
nuisance was not abated, the prisoners would themselves
go out and stop it. He gave them patient audience, and
promised them there should be no more trouble. About
the middle of July he attempted an exercise of authority
that cost him much of his popularity. For some time it
had been customary to make details of the prisoners to
do work outside the camp, they not being averse, as it
gave them a slight relief from the monotony of prison
life. On the 14th of July a detail was made as usual,
but when they found that the duty was to bring in a
Federal flagstaff and assist in raising it, they promptly
refused to work. An attempt was made at coercion, but
Col. Fundy, seeing that they would rather be shot down
than obey, sent them back to quarters. Finding that
none of the prisoners would volunteer, as a punishment,
he cut down their rations, which, prior to this time, had
been according to army regulations. Nothing more was
done in regard to the flagstaff for a week, when a detail
of Federal soldiers brought in the spar, and on the 29th
attempted to raise it in front of headquarters—a large
crowd of prisoners watching the operation, and greeting
with a yell each failure. Finally, the blue-coats accomplished
the feat, and, their hands relieved, they gave vent
to their wrath by hurling a volley of sticks and brickbats
at the jeering “rebs.” The latter were not slow to send
the missiles flying back, and the Federals, finding that in
this game they were getting worsted, started for their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
muskets. Of course the Confederates at once dispersed,
but a battery of artillery was brought out, so as to rake
the street, and the guards were in a state of chronic scare
for a day or two. The feeling between the prisoners and
guards was not very friendly, and the former delighted
in keeping the latter in fear of an outbreak. When there
was a prospect of stormy weather, the prisoners in the
tents would listen for the tramp of the sentinel, and when
he approached within earshot, they would discuss the
question of an outbreak, intimating that there was a plot
to escape on the first stormy night. On several occasions
the ruse succeeded so well that the garrison was
kept under arms in the rain nearly all night.</p>

<p>Practical jokes were common among the prisoners,
and served to relieve the monotony of their durance.
A jovial Irishman in Co. E, on one occasion, went to
the quarters of Co. K, and informed a number of his
acquaintances that his mess had a pot of soup that they
did not want, and invited them to bring their cups down
and get some. The guests, with tin-cups and spoons in
hand, followed their host to his tent, to find that the
soup-kettle had been accidentally upset and its contents
spread over the ground. Watching their opportunity,
the disappointed soup-eaters invited their joking Irish
friend, as he passed by, to sit down to a plate of fritters.
He accepted, only to get a mouthful of cotton covered
with batter and browned in the frying-pan. Sometimes
the jokes were of a rougher character, as when a member
of Co. C, who had eaten a very hearty dinner, was
given a drink of sherry, wine of ipecac, surreptitiously
obtained from the hospital.</p>

<p>Of books and other reading-matter there was a dearth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
and, as at other prisons, the men resorted to trinket-making
as a pastime. Rings, breastpins, crosses and
similar articles were turned off in great quantities, every
barrack and every tent being a manufactory. Bone,
vulcanized rubber, cocoanut-shell, mussel-shells, gold
and silver were the materials; old case-knives made into
saws, files, camp-made bow-drills, pocket-knives and sand-paper
the tools. From the rations of beef was obtained
the bone; mussel-shells were gathered in Sangamon
River by the water-details, the scanty pocket-money furnished
the gold and silver, while the files, sand-paper and
rubber in the form of buttons and rulers were procured
by trading rations with the commissary. The delicately-shaded
pink and white shells answered admirably for
mother-of-pearl for inlaying. No little taste and ingenuity
were displayed in the making of these articles.</p>

<p>The reception of the mail was an occasion of daily
excitement, and the postmaster was surrounded by an
eager crowd while the names of the lucky few were
called. Correspondence was limited to one page to a
letter, but the number of letters was limited only by the
prisoner’s ability to pay postage. But few letters came
through from the South, and the bulk of the mail was
for the Tennessee troops and those having friends in the
North. On June 28th a letter dated Camp Douglas,
Chicago, was received by Eli Sears from J. Hearndon,
giving us the first intelligence of those of the company
who were left at Island 10, sick. As previously mentioned,
these—nine in number—were sent to Madison,
Wis., where J. F. Smith died, May 15th, and C. J. Moncrief
on June 6th. Subsequently, we learned that E. F.
Brown died September 4th, at Camp Douglas, to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
camp they were transferred in June. The treatment of
the prisoners at these two camps was very different from
that at Camp Butler. No privileges were allowed; the
rations were insufficient to satisfy the cravings of hunger,
and as they were served to the prisoners cooked, there
was not the variety which tends to keep men in health.</p>

<p>About the middle of August the prisoners were enlivened
by the hope of exchange, and on the 1st of September
the work of making out the exchange-rolls began.
N. K. Adams, of Co. K, assisted, and from him were
obtained the following figures:—</p>

<p>On September 2d, those who took the oath of allegiance—mostly
from Tennessee—left for their homes.
On the 6th, one-half of those to be exchanged took the
cars for Alton, there to embark for Vicksburg; and on
the following day the remainder started, excepting a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
sick. The First Alabama prisoners were among the second
detachment. Many of the cars were open platforms,
and the trip in the hot sun to Alton was quite trying to
those who had been so long imprisoned. At Alton the
prisoners were transferred to transports, which left on
the 8th and arrived at Cairo on the 9th. There the remainder
of the Fort Donelson and Island 10 prisoners
joined us, and, on Thursday, September 11th, the fleet
steamed down the river. Several gunboats accompanied
the fleet, which proceeded only during the day, anchoring
or tying up to the bank at night. On the 12th, the
fleet passed Island No. 10, whose deserted earthworks
were fast caving into the river. At Memphis the fleet
remained two nights and a day. While there Jerry Stuart,
of Co. C, First Alabama, died and was buried. There
were some twenty-one or twenty-two deaths among the
prisoners while on the way down the river; and nearly
every night or morning there was one or more rude
graves dug on the bank wherever the fleet was lying,
and the uncoffined dead left behind. On the 18th we
passed a fleet of transports returning from Vicksburg
with Federal prisoners. Sunday morning, September
21st, the fleet anchored above Vicksburg, at the appointed
place of exchange; and on Monday morning
the prisoners were disembarked and marched across the
bend to the ferry opposite Vicksburg, where they crossed
over. The sick on the hospital boat were transferred to
a flag-of-truce boat from Vicksburg. The citizens had
prepared a bountiful barbecue, and did everything for
the prisoners’ comfort that their limited means permitted.
Lieuts. Hall and Tuttle met Co. K at Vicksburg—Capt.
Whitfield going on to Montgomery, Ala., on a brief
leave of absence.</p>

<p class="hanging allsmcap">CAPT. ISBELL AND HIS BATTALION—ARRIVAL AT PORT
HUDSON—BATTLE OF CORINTH—THE REUNITED REGIMENT—PORT
HUDSON—LAND DEFENCES—RED RIVER
SUPPLIES.</p>

</div>

<p>Upon its arrival at Vicksburg, the First Alabama Regiment
was quartered in the public-school building, where
they remained several days. The city, even then, bore
marks of the havoc of war. Shot and shell had torn
huge rents in the walls of the houses, and ploughed up
or dug great holes in which could have been buried a horse
and cart. On the bluffs, and along the water-front, were
batteries of heavy artillery, and soldiers were everywhere.
Such an air of desolation pervaded the city that it was a
relief to be ordered away. Two days after our arrival,
on September 24th, A. P. Brown died of disease contracted
at Camp Douglas. W. A. Dennis, who also
returned sick, was sent to the hospital at Lauderdale
Springs, where he died October 10th. On Saturday,
September 27th, the regiment took the cars for Jackson,
and, arriving there about noon, marched four miles out
of the city, and went into camp near the Sweet Water
Church. Here it remained till Wednesday, October 1st,
when orders were received to proceed to Port Hudson.
The regiment went by rail to Tangipahoa, La., and thence
marched 33½ miles to Clinton, arriving on the morning
of October 4th. The rest of the journey (20 miles) was
made via the Clinton and Port Hudson Railroad. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
road was not first-class, either in road-bed or equipment—flat
rails, on rotten stringers and ties, one locomotive,
one passenger car and half a dozen platform and box
cars. Only half of our regiment could be transported at
one trip; and, as it was the rule to run off the track at
certain points, night had fallen before the two trips were
made. The regiment encamped on the bluff in the rear
of Battery No. 1 (afterwards Battery 2), between the
village and depot.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Island No. 10, those who escaped,
and others absent on leave, were collected at Fort
Pillow and organized into three companies, under the
command of Capt. R. H. Isbell. In this battalion there
were the following members of Co. K: Lieut. M. E. Pratt,
O. S. Norman Cameron, Corp. W. L. Ellis, Privates E. L.
Averheart, Josiah Durden, John Griffin, E. Hearn, G.
Hearn, W. H. Hutchinson, Junius Robinson and G. H.
Royals. The battalion was attached to Gen. Villipigue’s
brigade; and soon after its organization was ordered to
Grenada, Miss., where it remained some ten days doing
provost duty. Thence it was ordered to North Mississippi
to meet a raid of the Federal cavalry, but the enemy
retired before its arrival. The summer months were spent
in camp at Abbeville and Cold Water.</p>

<p>Late in September, Gen. Villipigue’s brigade, including
Capt. Isbell’s battalion, was ordered to join Gen. Van
Dorn. The brigade arrived at Corinth, and was attached
to Lovell’s division, forming a part of the right of the
army. The first day’s fight (October 3d) resulted favorably
to the Confederates. On the second day it was
planned that Gen. Price should attack in force on the
left, and that, while thus engaged, Lovell’s division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
should press forward and attack vigorously on the right.
The attack was unfortunately delayed by the failure of
Gen. Herbert to advance till 8, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, giving Gen. Rosecrans
time to bring up fresh troops. Price drove the
enemy before him, and penetrated into the streets of the
town. Here his thinned brigades were attacked by the
fresh troops of the enemy, and driven in disorder back
over the ground they had won. Lovell, in the meantime,
was advancing in pursuance of his orders, but had
not yet engaged the enemy, when he received orders
to throw Villipigue’s brigade rapidly to the centre to
cover the retreat of Price’s broken ranks. This was gallantly
done; and if Capt. Isbell’s men had no opportunity
to win laurels in the battle, they won a glorious
meed of praise as a portion of the rear-guard in covering
the retreat. So well was the duty performed that Rosecrans
did not attack, and Gen. Van Dorn retired in safety.
The only serious molestation was a skirmish at the
Hatchie Bridge. After the retreat of the army to Oxford,
Gen. Villipigue’s brigade was ordered to Port Hudson,
where it arrived November 5th. There was great
rejoicing in the reunited company and regiment.</p>

<p>Gen. Villipigue died soon after his arrival (Nov. 9th),
of cholera morbus, and his remains were sent to Richmond
for interment, Corp. Ellis, of Co. K, being one of
the escort.</p>

<p>The regiment now numbered nearly 700 muskets, having
lost about 150 men since leaving Pensacola. Capt.
Isbell’s battalion brought with it a brass band; and, as
the regiment was by this time fairly well drilled, it made
a good military appearance on parade. The citizens of
Mobile had presented the regiment with a uniform on its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
return from prison. Its guns, though in good order, were
of a nondescript character—rifles, Springfield muskets,
altered flint-locks and flint-locks; Co. K, being last on
the list, had to put up with flint-locks. All the guns
were, however, provided with bayonets, which gave them
a uniform appearance. The men were in excellent spirits
and condition. On the arrival of the regiment in October
Cos. A, B and G were assigned to batteries, and on
December 31st Co. K was assigned to a battery to be
constructed.</p>

<p>Capt. Whitfield, who received a furlough after his exchange,
arrived at Port Hudson on November 8th; Lieut.
Pratt, on November 17th; and Lieut. Hall, who was furloughed
at Jackson, December 5th.</p>

<p>Port Hudson is in East Feliciana parish, La., on the
east bank of the Mississippi River, 25 miles above Baton
Rouge. Before the war it was a place of considerable
activity; about 30,000 bales of cotton and 2,000 hogsheads
of sugar were shipped there annually; there were
twelve or fifteen stores, and a population of some three
hundred. The bluff is very high—nearly 80 feet above
low water. At the time of the arrival of the First Alabama,
there were fourteen or fifteen guns mounted, varying
in size from 24-pounder siege guns to 8-inch shell
guns, and one 10-inch Columbiad. During the following
winter and spring several batteries were constructed and
additional guns mounted, so that at the beginning of the
siege, in May, 1863, the batteries and guns were as
follows:—</p>

<p>Battery No. 1 (signal battery)—Co. K, First Alabama,
one 30-pounder Parrott, calibre 4⁶²⁄₁₀₀ inches, siege carriage;
one 20-pounder rifle (brass), calibre 4⁶²⁄₁₀₀ inches, siege carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Battery No. 2—Co. A, First Alabama, one 42-pounder,
smooth-bore, barbette carriage; one rifle (old 24-pounder,
smooth-bore rifled, but not strengthened), barbette carriage;
one ditto, siege carriage.</p>

<p>Battery No. 3—Co. G, First Alabama, one smooth-bore,
42-pounder; one rifle, calibre 6 inches (old 32-pounder),
both mounted on barbette carriages.</p>

<p>Battery No. 4—De Gournay’s battalion, one 10-inch
Columbiad and one 8-inch Columbiad, Columbiad carriages.</p>

<p>Battery No. 5—Co. B, First Alabama, one 10-inch
Columbiad, Columbiad carriage; one 32-pounder, barbette
carriage.</p>

<p>Battery No. 6—De Gournay’s battalion, one rifle (old
32-pounder); one rifle (old 24-pounder).</p>

<p>Battery No. 7—Tennessee company attached to De
Gournay’s battalion, hot-shot battery, two 24-pounders.</p>

<p>Batteries Nos. 8 and 9—De Gournay’s battalion, each
one 24-pounder, siege carriages, water batteries.</p>

<p>Battery No. 10—De Gournay’s battalion, one 8-inch
shell-gun, barbette carriage, water battery.</p>

<p>Battery No. 11—Miles’ legion, one 20-pounder Parrott,
extreme right of the land defenses.</p>

<p>The batteries were nearly all provided with bomb-proof
magazines, but with no protection for the men except the
low parapet. From Battery No. 1 to 11 it was a little
over one mile.</p>

<p>A system of land defenses had been planned, and work
slowly progressed during the winter of 1862-3. The
full plans of the engineers were never carried out, and at
the commencement of the siege the works on the northern
side had not been begun. As planned the defenses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
began at Battery No. 11 and extended in a semi-circular
direction for a distance of over four miles, striking the
river near the mouth of Sandy Creek, about one mile
above Battery No. 1. The earthworks, where completed,
consisted of a crémaillère line, broken by occasional
lunettes and redans for artillery. Where the ground was
open and favorable to assault, the ditch was from three to
four feet deep and five or six feet wide. From the bottom
of the ditch to the top of the parapet it was, in no
case, more than seven or eight feet, except when increased
by the natural features of the ground, as in front
of Battery No. 11, where there was a deep ravine. In
Northern publications, maps are given showing a very
complete system of defenses, with inner and outer lines,
but these, if planned, were not constructed—there being
but a single line of works, except that during the siege
inner lines were constructed across points mined by the
enemy, as at the northeast angle and Battery No. 11.</p>

<p>During the autumn and winter of 1862-3 communication
was open between Vicksburg and Port Hudson, and
both places were supplied with provisions from the Red
River country. Transports arrived quite regularly from
Red River at Port Hudson, until interrupted by the blockade
established by Farragut in March, 1863. Cattle were
driven from Texas for the use of the garrison; great herds
of long-horned oxen swimming the Mississippi, was a
curious but not uncommon sight. The cattle arrived in
very good condition, but as there was but poor pasturage
at Port Hudson some became skeletonized before they
were slaughtered.</p>

<p>The commissariat during the six months preceding the
siege was generally good. Plentiful rations of corn meal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
beef, sugar, molasses and salt were issued, and sometimes
potatoes. Some extras could also be purchased in the
surrounding country, while the river and cypress ponds
furnished fish.</p>

<p>The cooking was done in camp, the messes detailing
some of their own number or hiring negro cooks. Ladies
from the neighborhood quite frequently visited camp and
showed much interest in the culinary department. A
motherly old lady, on one occasion, after watching the
movements of one of Co. K’s cooks for some time, told
the amateur, who had felt somewhat complimented by the
attention, that she thought it would improve his kettles
if he would burn them out. It is needless to say that he
took the first opportunity of getting rid of the surplus
soot and grease on his cooking utensils by following the
advice.</p>

<p>Col. Steadman at once began a strict system of discipline
and drill. The following was the order of the day:
Reveille at daybreak with roll-call, inspection of arms
and policing of camps; 6 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, drill in the school of the
soldier; 7 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, breakfast; 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, guard mounting;
9 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, non-commissioned officers’ drill; 10 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, drill in
the school of the company; 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span>, dinner; 1 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, skirmish
drill; 3 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, battalion drill; 5 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, dress parade;
sunset, retreat; 9 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, taps. Companies assigned to batteries
drilled at the guns at the hours for the company
drill. Strict regimental guard was kept up, all the requirements
of the army regulations being enforced.</p>

<p>The first call to action was on Sunday, November 16th,
1862, when the Federal fleet appeared at the head of
Prophet’s Island, below Port Hudson. The regiment
was ordered to strike tents and pack knapsacks; while
the left wing, including Co. K, was deployed along the
bank as sharpshooters. In a short time the fleet retired
and the troops were ordered back to camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>On the evening of December 13, 1862, Capt. Boone’s
company of Light Artillery, supported by Co’s D and F
of the First Alabama, crossed the river and after dark
moved down opposite the anchorage of the iron clad
Essex and a wooden vessel. The guns, consisting of two
smooth-bore 6-pounders and one 12-pound howitzer were
planted behind the levee, and at daylight the next morning
fire was opened on the wooden vessel. The fire was
so effective that the Essex had to steam up and interpose
her iron sides for the protection of her consort. Both
vessels then retired down the river. Although the
Federal vessels kept up a heavy fire our loss was but one
man wounded.</p>

<p>During the early part of December the regiment was
busy constructing barracks of willow logs, the roofs
covered with cypress boards. Co. K built two cabins,
which were completed about the last of the month.
They were 18 by 22 feet, with a large fireplace at each
end. The chimneys were built of sticks daubed with
clay. An open door way furnished entrance and light,
while ventilation was secured by leaving the upper cracks
between the logs unchinked; bunks were built in tiers
along the walls, and the men were very comfortably
quartered for the winter.</p>

<p>On December 31st Capt. Whitfield received the
promise of a one gun battery—a 30-pound Parrott gun—on
the condition that his company build the battery and
magazine. The battery was laid off above the redan,
then known as Battery No. 1, but separated from it by a
deep ravine. Co. K worked alone on their battery till
January 8th, when details were made from the infantry
companies of the regiment to assist them. By the 18th<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
of January the work was so nearly completed that the
gun was brought up from Battery No. 11 and put into
position. The magazine was not completed till the last
of February, the powder being stored in it on March 2,
1863. The gun was christened the “Lady Whitfield.”</p>

<p>On December 26th, Lieut. Tuttle and Corp. John Hearn
left for Alabama to secure recruits for Co. K. They returned
in February having secured 45, as follows:—</p>

<p>In addition to these Henry Fralick, of Autauga Co.,
joined the company in September, 1862.</p>

<p>Second Lieut. Dixon S. Hall having resigned from ill
health, Junior Second Lieut. Tuttle was promoted, and
an election was held March 4, 1863, for Junior Second
Lieutenant, resulting as follows: John Frank, Jr., 35;
Norman Cameron, 20; N. K. Adams, 8; John Frank, Jr.,
was thereupon duly commissioned.</p>

<p>On March 12, 1863, Moses Tarleton, of Lowndes Co.,
one of the recruits, died, and was buried with military
honors. This was the only one of the company, owing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
in other cases of death to lack of opportunity, to whom
these honors were paid.</p>

<p>Company K, having a full complement of men, and
having but one gun in its battery, was divided as to duty.
One portion was drilled as heavy artillery, another portion
as infantry, while Lieut. Tuttle with the remainder
was detailed to act with a detachment of the regiment
under command of Major Knox as river police. The
company was jocularly known, in consequence of this
division, as “Whitfield’s Legion.”</p>

<p>On the afternoon of March 13, 1863, several of
Admiral Farragut’s vessels appeared in sight below Port
Hudson, anchoring near the head of Prophets Island, and
when the fog lifted on the morning of the 14th, his whole
fleet lay at anchor just out of range of our guns. There
were eight magnificent war steamers, one iron clad and
six mortar boats. The flag ship was the steam-frigate
“Hartford,” with an armament of 26 eight and nine-inch
Paixhan guns. The “Richmond,” a ship of the same
class, was armed with 26 eight and nine-inch Columbiads;
the side-wheel steam-frigate “Mississippi” had 19 eight-inch
guns, 1 ten-inch, 1 twenty-pound Parrott and 2
howitzers in her tops; the “Monongahela,” steam-sloop of
war, carried 16 heavy guns; the gunboats “Kineo,”
“Albatross,” “Sachem,” and “Genesee” each carried 3
heavy Columbiads and 2 six-inch rifles. All of these but
the “Mississippi” were screw propellers. In addition to
the above vessels all of which, except the “Sachem,” were
to attempt to run the batteries, there was the iron clad
“Essex” carrying 10 heavy guns and also six mortar-boats,
each carrying 1 thirteen-inch mortar. These last
were to cover the advance of the fleet by fiercely shelling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the Confederate batteries. The mortar-boats were moored
close under the river bank at the head of Prophets Island,
and were protected from the Confederate batteries by the
bluff which at that point curved almost at a right angle.
The “Essex” was anchored in the stream opposite the
mortar-boats, and the other vessels some distance lower
down but in sight.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 14th, the fleet opened fire apparently
to get the range of our batteries. About seventy-five
shot and shell were thrown, but the batteries made
no response. All the batteries were manned as night approached,
while the infantry were at the fortifications on
the land side, prepared to resist any attack by Gen.
Banks’ forces. Until 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> all was quiet, then a red
light was displayed from the mast-head of the “Hartford,”
the signal for the fleet to prepare for action. As
the vessels passed his station, about 11 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, Capt. Youngblood,
of the Confederate signal corps, sent up a rocket
and the sentinels on the batteries fired their muskets, conveying
the alarm from the lower to the upper works. In
a few minutes the eighteen guns in position along the
bluff were ready for action. At the wharf lay two Red
River transports unloading; on board all was confusion,
the shrieks of the women, the shouts of the officers to
their crews, the glare of light from the cabins and furnaces,
contrasted strangely with the death-like stillness
and darkness of the batteries on the bluff. Just as the
transports steamed away from the wharf on their way to
Thompson’s Creek, up which they sought safety, Gen.
Gardner came dashing up to Battery No. 1, and seeing
the lights on these vessels and mistaking them for the
gunboats called out to Capt. Whitfield, “Why don’t you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
fire on those boats?” John Hearn, not recognizing the
General, replied, “They are our transports, you infernal
thief.” The commandant, either not hearing or concluding
that under some circumstances deafness was commendable,
made no response.</p>

<p>So soon as the alarm was given, the Federal fleet began
firing; the mortar-boats—the “Essex” and the “Sachem”—moored
to the bank or lying at anchor, with guns trained
during the preceding day, had quite accurate range; but
the practice of the moving vessels was somewhat wild till
they were at close quarters. Orders had been issued to
permit the enemy to get well in range before opening
fire, and it was not until the leading vessel was nearly
opposite Battery No. 11 that the first gun was discharged
from the bluff. Instantly flash after flash revealed the
positions of the Confederate artillery. The “Hartford,”
with the “Albatross” lashed to her larboard side, was
in the advance; the “Richmond” and “Genesee,” the
“Monongahela” and “Kineo” followed, and the “Mississippi”
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>At Battery No. 1 the upward passage of the fleet could
only be traced by the flashes of its guns. Huge bonfires
had been built under the bluff to illuminate the river,
but the smoke of the pine wood only served to render
impenetrable the darkness of the night, and they were
immediately extinguished. Later in the battle, the signal
corps, on the other side of the river, fired an old building,
and the flames from this in a measure revealed the position
of the vessels as they passed between it and the
batteries. So soon as the Confederates opened, the fire
of the fleet, no longer directed at random, was redoubled,
and the roar of its hundred heavy guns and mortars,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
added to that of the rapidly-served artillery of the garrison,
was fearful. Howitzers in the tops of the steamers
swept the bluffs and gave some annoyance to the gunners.
Leaving the rest of the ships to follow as best
they could, the “Hartford” and her consort moved steadily
on past the fortifications, rounded the point, and,
pouring a farewell broadside of grape and shrapnel into
Batteries Nos. 1, 2, and 3, steamed out of range up the
river.</p>

<p>The “Richmond” and “Genesee” followed close in the
wake of the “Hartford” till opposite Batteries Nos. 4 and
5, when a rifle-shell piercing the steam-drum of the former
disabled her, and another shot passing through the smoke-stack
mortally wounded Lieut. Boyd Cummings, her
commander. A dozen other wounds in hull and rigging
attested the accurate gunnery of the Confederates. Turning,
by aid of her consort, both steamers came close
under the bluff, where, for a few minutes, they were protected,
and some one on board yelled out, with an oath,
“Now let us see you hit us!” A moment later, as they
ran out into the channel, both were raked. A shell
exploding in the ward-room of the “Genesee” set the
vessel on fire, but the flames were speedily extinguished,
and after running the gauntlet a second time, the crippled
ships got back to their anchorage.</p>

<p>The “Monongahela” and “Kineo” met with but little
better fortune. A 32-pound cannon-ball cut the tiller-ropes
of the former, another shot demolished the bridge
and seriously wounded Capt. McKinistry, her commander,
while her decks were strewed with dead and
wounded. About the time the tiller-ropes of the “Monongahela”
were shot away, a 32-pound ball struck the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
rudder-post of the “Kineo.” Both thus disabled, the
“Monongahela” ran into the bank, and the hawsers which
lashed the ships together parting, the “Kineo” shot
ahead and also ran into the bank. Backing off, the
“Kineo” dragged with her the “Monongahela”; but the
propeller fouled in the parted hawser, and the two vessels
drifted helplessly down the river, letting go their anchors
when out of range.</p>

<p>The pilot of the steamship “Mississippi,” confused by
the smoke of the battle, ran that vessel ashore at the
point directly opposite Batteries Nos. 3, 4 and 5. Her
commander, Capt. Melancthon Smith, used every endeavor
to get his vessel off, but in vain. In the meantime
her guns poured forth an almost continuous sheet of
flame. Deserted by all her consorts she received the concentrated
fire of the batteries. A rifle shot, probably
from Battery No. 1, knocked a howitzer from her maintop
clear of the vessel into the water. One after another
her heavy guns had been disabled, and thirty of her
crew had fallen, when her commander gave the order to
abandon her. The dead were left on the decks, four of
the wounded were taken ashore, others leaped into the
river; those who were unhurt got to shore some by
swimming and others in the boats. Before all had left
the doomed vessel flames burst forth, by whom set is a
disputed question. Capt. Smith reported that he fired
the vessel, while the men in the hot-shot battery as
strenuously insisted that she was fired by them, another
report stated that a shell exploded in some combustibles
arranged on her deck for the purpose of firing
her. Some of those who escaped to shore made their
way down the river bank to the fleet, swimming the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
crevasses; 62, including two officers, were taken prisoners
the next morning. The flames spread rapidly, soon enveloping
the hull and shrouds. As the flames reached the
larboard guns, they were discharged one after another
towards the vessels which had gone up the river, while
shells on her decks kept up a constant fusilade. From
the time that efforts had been given up to get her off,
there had been a constant shriek of escaping steam from
her safety valve. Lightened by the flames she floated off
the bar and drifted, a huge pyramid of fire, down the
river illuminating its broad expanse till all was bright as
day, and revealing the shattered vessels of the fleet as
they hastily steamed out of the way of their dangerous
consort. Long after she had passed around the bend
the light of the flames reflected on the sky marked her
progress. About 5 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, when at almost the identical
spot where the Confederate ram “Arkansas” was blown
up, the fire reached the magazine and the “Mississippi”
existed only in story. The shock of the explosion was
felt at Port Hudson, twenty miles distant.</p>

<p>The battle lasted from about 11 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> to 2 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> Co. K
fired their one gun 32 times. Lieut. Pratt had immediate
charge of the gun, Capt. Whitfield being also present.
Sergeants Ellis and Royals were the gunners and Wm.
H. Fay the ordnance sergeant. Lieut. Tuttle was on
duty with the river patrol. The eighteen Confederate
guns fired altogether about six hundred shot and shell.
Of which, according to Federal reports, at least one
hundred struck the attacking vessels, as the “Hartford”
alone was struck over thirty times. The loss of the First
Alabama was three men slightly wounded. One man
was killed at the land fortifications, and one man wounded
in one of the lower batteries. Not a gun was injured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>The enemy’s losses may be summed up as follows:
the “Mississippi,” burned; the “Richmond,” completely
disabled and obliged to return to New Orleans for repairs;
the “Genesee,” slightly damaged by fire; the “Monongahela,”
bridge shot away and tiller ropes cut; the
“Kineo,” rudder disabled and rigging badly cut up.
Casualties, “Hartford,” 3 killed and 2 wounded; “Albatross,”
3 killed and 2 wounded; “Richmond,” 4 killed
and 7 wounded; “Monongahela,” 7 killed and 21 wounded;
“Mississippi,” 22 killed and 8 wounded; and 62
prisoners: total 39 killed, 40 wounded and 62 prisoners,
including 2 commissioned officers. One of the latter,
Midshipman Francis, was paroled in consideration of his
gallant efforts to save the lives of some Confederate
prisoners, who fell overboard from the flag of truce
steamer “Frolic,” at Baton Rouge, a few weeks before,
while en route to be exchanged. The other prisoners
were sent to Richmond. Federal accounts of the battle
state that the fire of the batteries was so accurate as to
threaten the destruction of every vessel exposed. The
gunners of Battery No. 1 labored under a disadvantage,
as the smoke settled in a dense bank in front of the
battery, but there was reason to believe that their gun did
good execution.</p>

<p>Gen. Banks with 25,000 men was to have attacked by
land, while Farragut assailed the river defences. On the
evening of the 13th the divisions of Gens. Grover and
Emory left Baton Rouge and were followed the next
morning by Gen. Augur’s division. Gen. Banks establishing
his headquarters at the crossing of the Springfield
road, seven miles below Port Hudson. Friday afternoon
the enemy’s advance guard encountered the Confederate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
pickets and a sharp skirmish followed, in which several
men were killed and wounded. The following day there
was another skirmish in which the Federals were worsted,
losing a number of officers, killed, wounded and prisoners.
They made no further demonstration till Monday when
Gen. Rust’s brigade attacked their rear guard as they
were retiring and drove them six miles. The main body
made no offer of battle, and the rear guard burned the
bridges to prevent further pursuit. Thus ingloriously
ended this attempt to capture Port Hudson by a force
many times that of the garrison.</p>

<p>The mortar fleet, “Essex,” and one or two other vessels,
remained until March 28th, shelling the batteries,
camps and transports at the wharves nearly every day,
without, however, coming within range of the Confederate
guns. On the 18th, the enemy landed a force of
infantry and artillery on the west bank and burned the
residence of Capt. Hines, the lower batteries shelling
the raiders that night.</p>

<p>The “Hartford” and “Albatross” having gone up to
Grand Gulf leaving the Red River open, several transports
with supplies came down. On the 21st, while
these were unloading, just above Battery No. 1, the fleet
opened fire forcing them to steam up Thompson’s Creek.
The rifle shells fell around our battery and camp. On
the 24th, the enemy fired a sugar-mill opposite Port
Hudson, our batteries shelling them as they retired. A
battery of light artillery planted by the enemy behind the
levee shelled our lower batteries on the 25th but without
effect. On the 28th the fleet steamed down the river.
Admiral Farragut with the “Hartford,” “Albatross” and
ram “Switzerland,” the last named having run the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Vicksburg batteries, appeared above Port Hudson on
April 6th, and on the 7th several vessels came up from
below and exercised their guns for a while. There was
a false alarm on the night of April 9th, caused by a raft
with a fire on it floating down the river; it was boarded
by the river patrol and the fire extinguished.</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Baldwin, who had been appointed Chaplain
of the regiment, preached his first sermon on Sunday,
April 12th. Nothing of special interest beyond an occasional
visit from the gunboats occurred until May
5th, when the fleet above Port Hudson fired the
“Hermitage” and another building. On May 6th Co. K
received another gun, a rifled brass piece, 4⁶²⁄₁₀₀ inches
calibre, captured on Amité river. It was clumsily
mounted on a 24-pounder siege carriage, and christened
“The Baby.” In anticipation of receiving this gun a
battery had already been prepared for it beside the old one.</p>

<p>The mortar fleet, the “Essex” and the “Richmond,”
having appeared again below Port Hudson, orders were
received on May 9th for a detachment of Co. K to take
“The Baby” to Troth’s landing and at daylight on the
10th open fire on the fleet. The entire expedition under
command of Lieut. Col. DeGournay consisted of one
24-pounder rifled, with a detachment from DeGournay’s
battalion; one 4⁶²⁄₁₀₀ inch brass rifle, detachments from
Co. K, First Alabama Regiment; one 20-pounder and
one 12-pounder Parrott guns, with detachments from
Miles’ Legion. Of Co. K there were 17 men, Sergeants
Ellis and Royals, gunners, under command of Lieut.
Tuttle. Soon after dark on the evening of the 9th a fatigue
party began work, and during the night constructed a
rude redoubt 12 by 24 feet, sinking it eighteen inches in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
the ground and throwing the earth to the front, thus forming
an open earthwork with a parapet just high enough
for the muzzles of the guns to project over. In this were
placed the two larger guns, while the two Parrotts were
placed in an old battery a few hundred yards lower down.
From 11 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> till 1 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> the mortars shelled the batteries,
but did not discover the working party. Shortly after
4 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> the earthwork was completed and the guns were
put in position. While the fatigue party were still standing
around, the flash and roar of the mortars caused a
stampede of the non-combatants. As before, the shells
were thrown at the batteries above, showing that the expedition
was still undiscovered. The guns were loaded
and so soon as it was sufficiently light were aimed at the
“Essex;” then the command rang out “Fire!” The
percussion shell from “The Baby” striking on the projecting
point of land between us and the “Essex” exploded,
the fragments rattling on the iron sides of that
vessel. The guns were now loaded and fired as rapidly
as possible, being directed at the “Essex” and mortar-boats.
The latter were, however, moored close under the
bluff and were secure except from fragments of bursting
shells. As we afterwards learned the surprise of the
enemy was complete; it took them but a few minutes,
however, to recover, and shells from the mortars soon
transcribed a shorter curve, exploding over our guns or
burying themselves in the earth around them. Next the
eight and nine-inch guns of the “Essex” opened, and a
few minutes later a 100-pound rifle missile from the “Richmond”
burst just as it passed the battery. The earth fairly
shook as mortars, Columbiads, rifles and bursting shells
joined in one continuous roar on that pleasant Sabbath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
morning. At the twenty-eighth shot, owing to the breaking
of a chin-bolt holding on the trunnion-cap, “The
Baby” was disabled. A few minutes before this the
“Richmond” moved from her anchorage, and steamed
towards the batteries; the last shot from the brass gun
went hurtling through her rigging, and the last shot left
in the locker of the 24-pounder struck her under the
quarter; the Parrotts, from lack of ammunition, or some
other cause, had ceased firing, so the batteries were silent.
The “Richmond” came steadily on until within about
400 yards firing rapidly, then turning and giving in succession
both broadsides she steamed back to her anchorage.
The fleet now ceased firing and a death-like stillness
followed the terrific roar of the battle.</p>

<p>Co. K had one man, Clark, wounded, a fragment of a
shell cutting off two of his fingers. One man was mortally
wounded and a Lieutenant severely wounded at the Parrott
guns. There was also one or two casualties in the
infantry support, and a man was killed in one of the
regular batteries. The damage to the enemy was trifling;
the “Essex” was struck about a dozen times by fragments
of shell and once fairly by a solid shot. Four shot hit or
passed through the rigging of the “Richmond.” One of
the mortar-boats was struck in the bow and another on
the deck by fragments of shells, and it was reported that
several of the crews were wounded.</p>

<p>As soon as the firing ceased ropes were attached to the
trails of the guns, and they were drawn out of battery,
limbered up and taken back to camp. The enemy,
curiously, did not re-open fire during the removal, thus
showing that they were very willing to have the guns
taken away. When the “Richmond” was seen to leave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
her anchorage, Lieut. Pratt with the 30-pounder Parrott
started for Battery No. 11, but before he could get there
the steamer was out of range.</p>

<p>On May 12th and 14th the infantry companies of the
regiment were sent to the breastworks in anticipation of
an attack, a body of the enemy having cut the railroad
between Port Hudson and Clinton. On the 14th there
was a skirmish at Plain’s store, six and a half miles from
Port Hudson. Communication with Clinton was reopened
on the 15th, and the accumulated mails of several
weeks arrived, some 1,500 pounds of letters, greatly
rejoicing the whole garrison. On Saturday, the 16th,
there was another alarm, and a detachment of Co. K, with
the brass rifle, was sent to the breastworks, remaining till
Monday night, when they returned to camp. On the
18th a cavalry force under Col. Grierson made a raid on
a small Confederate detachment guarding cattle, capturing
the beeves and about 40 men. The same day four or
five officers and privates of the First Alabama, who were
fishing west of the river were captured. It was reported
that Simpson of Co. K was among those picked up, but he
came in the next day. On the 19th the infantry companies
of the First Alabama were sent across the river and had a
skirmish. Several of the enemy were killed, but our
regiment suffered no loss. There was also skirmishing
in the direction of Plain’s store on the 19th and 20th.
The fleet below had for some days been regularly shelling
the batteries but without effect. On the 17th the
“Genesee” came up within range of Battery No. 11 and
was fired upon with a 20-pound Parrott. An Admiral’s
salute of seventeen guns was fired at noon on the 18th
by the “Richmond,” announcing, it was supposed, the
return of Admiral Farragut. This brings us to the
memorable siege of Port Hudson.</p>

</div>

<p>The initiatory steps of the siege of Port Hudson may
be reckoned from May 20th, 1863, when Gen. Augur,
with his own and Gen. Sherman’s division, advanced
from Baton Rouge. Gen. Banks, who had been campaigning
in the Teche country, embarking his troops at
Shreveport, landed at Bayou Sara, five miles above Port
Hudson, on the 21st. His forces consisted of the
divisions of Gens. Grover and Emory, Gen. Weitzel’s
brigade of sappers and miners and two regiments of
negro troops. A junction was effected with Gen. Augur’s
command on the 22d, thus closely investing the
position. Gen. Banks then assumed command, his forces
consisting of four divisions, one brigade and two unattached
regiments, numbering from twenty-five to thirty
thousand men. To resist this army, Gen. Frank Gardner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
had Beale’s brigade, consisting of the First and Twenty-ninth
Mississippi regiments, the Tenth and Fifteenth
Arkansas and the Forty-ninth Alabama; Lieut.-Col.
Miles’ Legion; the First Alabama acting as heavy artillery;
DeGournay’s battalion of heavy artillery; a Tennessee
company of heavy artillery; several companies of
Mississippi light artillery, and some dismounted cavalry—all
told, about six thousand men. Col. DeGournay, in
an account of the siege, also mentions the Twelfth, Sixteenth,
Eighteenth and Twenty-third Arkansas regiment,
First Arkansas battalion, Ninth Louisiana battalion,
a battalion of Texans from Maxey’s brigade; but
he places the number fit for duty at the beginning of the
siege at only five thousand, the Arkansas regiments being
skeletons.</p>

<p>On the 21st, Gen. Gardner sent out Col. Miles, with
400 cavalry and a battery, to reconnoitre in the direction
of Plain’s Stores. About four miles from Port Hudson
they encountered Gen. Augur’s advance, and a severe
skirmish of two and a half hours followed. The Confederate
loss was thirty killed and forty wounded. At
the same time Col. Powers’ cavalry, 300 strong, had a
skirmish on the Bayou Sara road, and, being cut off, did
not return to Port Hudson. When night fell the other
forces were recalled within the fortifications. From Saturday,
the 23d, to Tuesday, the 26th, the enemy were
engaged in taking positions, the close investment being
completed on the 24th. The First Alabama, with the
exception of detachments at the guns, went to the front
on the 23d, and were stationed on the northern line, at
that time unfortified. Col. Steadman having been assigned
to the command of the left wing of the garrison,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
Lieut.-Col. Locke commanded the regiment. Gen. Beale
had command of the centre, and Col. Miles of the right.
On the 24th there was heavy skirmishing, the First Alabama
being engaged. The same day an order was issued
for the brass rifle to be taken to a redan near the Jackson
road. Lieut. Frank, with a detachment of the sick
and cooks—the only men of the company in camp—went
with the gun and opened fire at long range upon a
battery of the enemy, which was soon silenced. This
gun remained at the Jackson road redan during the entire
siege, the gunners suffering severely, and the gun
being several times dismounted. On the 25th the First
Alabama was again heavily engaged skirmishing, keeping
back the enemy, while at the same time hurriedly
fortifying, and lost twelve or fifteen men in killed and
wounded. On the 26th the 30-pound Parrott was sent
down to Battery No. 11 with a detachment of Co. K,
under command of Lieut. Pratt, Sergt. Williamson, gunner,
and a 24-pounder, rifled, was transferred from Battery
No. 2 to No. 1. Lieut. Tuttle was in charge of Battery
No. 1, and Lieut. Frank remained at the Jackson redan
with the brass gun. Most of the 24-pounders were transferred
from the river batteries to the fortifications, their
places being supplied with Quaker guns. On the 26th
there was but little firing, both armies preparing for the
work of the following day.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 27th the enemy opened
a heavy fire from both the land batteries and the fleet,
and at 6, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, the Federal troops advanced to the assault.
The heaviest attack was directed against the Confederate
left, the assaulting column consisting of Grover’s
and Emory’s divisions, Weitzel’s brigade and the two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
regiments of negro troops. On the extreme left the
negroes, supported by a brigade of whites, crossed Sandy
Creek and assaulted the position held by Col. Shelby
with the Twenty-ninth Mississippi. They advanced at a
double-quick till within about 150 yards of the works,
when the 24-pounder in Battery No. 1, manned by Co.
K, and two pieces of light artillery on Col. Shelby’s line,
opened on them; at the same time they were received
with volleys of musketry from the Mississippians. The
negroes turned and fled, without firing a shot. About
250 of them were killed and wounded in front of the
works; but the Federal reports stated that 600 were
killed and wounded. If this were correct, they must have
been shot down by the white brigade in their rear; and,
indeed, volleys of musketry were heard in the direction
of their flight. The First Alabama, Lieut.-Col. Locke,
and the Tenth Arkansas, Col, Witt, engaged the enemy
outside the entrenchments in the thick woods, and fought
most gallantly; but were compelled, by the heavy force
brought against them, to fall back across Sandy Creek.
Col. Johnson, with the Fifteenth Arkansas, 300 men,
occupied and fortified a hill jutting out from the line,
and held it till the close of the siege, though desperate
efforts were made to dislodge them; on the 27th they
repulsed a very heavy assault, the enemy’s dead in front
of the position numbering eighty or ninety. Gen. Beale’s
command in the centre, and Col. Miles’ on the right, were
assailed by Augur’s and Sherman’s divisions about 2, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>,
but the enemy was everywhere repulsed with heavy loss.
At the Jackson road the detachment of Co. K, Lieut.
Frank commanding, who were serving the brass rifle,
were, with but one exception, killed or wounded. While<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
ramming a charge home, Private Henry Smith was mortally
wounded by a sharpshooter; Corp. Fergerson
promptly stepped to his place, and was instantly fatally
shot. In the meantime Private Hayes had been stricken
down. Private Sears was busy attending the wounded
and Lieut. Frank and Sergt. Ellis fired the gun themselves
several rounds, the former pointing and the latter
loading. While doing this Lieut. Frank fell, pierced
by a Minie ball; by his request, Sergt. Ellis carried him
out of the battery to Gen. Beale’s headquarters, and gave
him some water from the General’s canteen. Sergt.
Ellis then asked for more men, and the General sent
his courier to the rear for a detachment, which came under
Lieut. Tuttle’s command. Lieut. Frank and Corp. Fergerson
died that night; Private Smith lingered until July 10th;
Private Hayes’ wound was slight. Near the camp, Private
Winslett was instantly killed by a shell while on his
way to Battery No. 11 with the Parrott gun. The final
effort of the day was made about 3, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, when the enemy,
under cover of a white flag, made a dash on a portion of
our lines, but they were easily repulsed. All day the fleet
kept up an incessant firing upon the lower batteries, but
did no damage. The Confederates had about 5,500 muskets
at the breastworks; and had the men been evenly
distributed, they would have been about three feet apart.
Fortunately, the nature of the ground enabled Gen. Gardner
to leave long stretches of the works defended only by
pickets; and, as the charges were not simultaneous, troops
were hurried from one point to another where most needed.
The fortifications, as previously stated, consisted of an
ordinary field earthwork, over any portion of which, at
the beginning of the siege—it was materially strengthened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
during the 48 days at exposed points—a fox hunter could
have leaped. In some places, in fact, as in front of the
First Alabama, there were no breastworks. Against this
small force and weak defences Banks hurled nearly his
whole army of 25,000 men, who fought bravely, but were
badly handled. Gen. Banks loss was 293 killed and 1,549
wounded; the Confederate loss was about 200 killed and
wounded. The Confederates picked up outside the works
the following night a considerable number of Enfield
rifles. These guns, with others subsequently captured,
were retained at the works, and ere the close of the siege
most of the men were armed with two guns each—a
musket loaded with buck and ball for use at close quarters,
and a rifle for sharp shooting. As the fixed ammunition
for the Enfield’s became exhausted, the men used
the powder from musket cartridges, and for lead picked
up Minie balls fired into the place by the enemy. These
Yankee leaden missiles were also used instead of canister
and were so thick on the surface of the ground within our
lines, that it was but the work of a few minutes to pick
up enough to charge a 12-pounder gun.</p>

<p>During the bombardment, on the 27th, a rifle shell from
the fleet struck in Battery No. 5 disabling the 10-inch Columbiad
carriage and killing a private of Co. G, First Alabama.
A squad from Co. K worked in that battery on
the nights of the 27th and 28th in dismounting and remounting,
after the repair of the carriage, this 10-inch
gun, which was ready for service again on the 29th. The
man who was killed was standing on the carriage and was
literally torn to pieces.</p>

<p>On the 28th there was a cessation of hostilities at the
breastworks for the purpose of burying the dead. Gen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
Banks did not deem it worth while to bury the colored
troops who “fought nobly,” and their bodies lay festering
in the sun till the close of the siege, when the colored
regiments gathered the bones of their unfortunate
brothers-in-arms and buried them.</p>

<p>At 7 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the truce ended and the enemy made a
furious rush upon the position held by the First Alabama.
The fighting lasted nearly an hour, but the enemy were
gallantly repulsed. The armistice did not embrace the
river batteries and fleet, and the firing from the latter was
unusually heavy. As previously mentioned Lieut. Pratt
had received orders to take the 30-pounder Parrott, with
a detachment from Co. K to Battery No. 11. An old
24-pounder, rifled, manned by a detachment from Col.
DeGournay’s battalion was also ordered to report to
him at the same battery. His orders were to open upon
the enemy’s fleet at daylight, but owing to the darkness
of the night and the road being torn up by shells, it was
after sunrise when the guns were got into position. The
battery was very small, having been built for one gun
only, and the parapet was but little over knee-high. About
6 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, everything being in readiness, Lieut. Pratt opened
fire with the two guns upon the “Essex” anchored one
mile or more distant. Within ten minutes the little battery
was receiving the concentrated fire of the fleet including
the six mortar-boats. The “Essex,” owing to
her position, was the most accurate in her fire; three
shells from her nine-inch guns exploded on the platform
of the battery, and one struck a canteen hanging on the
knob of the cascable of the Parrott. Private Joe Tunnell
was slightly wounded by this shell; he was thrown upon
his face and it was supposed he was killed, but he got up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
and brushing the dirt from his face exclaimed, “Well,
boys they liked to have got me.” His wound though
not serious disabled him, and Lieut. Pratt, in addition to
his own duties as commander, had to assist in serving the
gun. Lieut. Pratt was himself wounded during the action,
but did not leave the battery; he was standing on the
parapet watching the effect of the fire, when a shell exploded
in the earth under his feet, and threw him into the
battery, while fragments of the shell struck him on the
hand and hip. Never did men act with more coolness
than those at these guns, nor has artillery often been more
ably served. There were fired from Co. K’s gun 49 shot
and shell, and from the other piece 50. The enemy’s
vessels were struck repeatedly; one shell from the Parrott
was seen to enter a port-hole of the “Essex,” after
which she closed her ports and, without firing another
shot, retired out of range. The “Genesee” was also
struck, and it was thought partially crippled. In addition
to the casualties in Co. K, one man at the other
gun was wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy made no more general assaults upon the
works until June 14th, but in the meantime were approaching
by parallels and planting batteries of heavy
siege and naval guns. A steady fire was kept up day and
night both by the fleet and the land batteries. There were
about eighty siege pieces in these latter. An eight-inch
howitzer so planted as to enfilade a portion of the southern
line of defences, caused much amusement as well as
annoyance to the Confederates. It was fired with light
charges so as to make the shell ricochet and was, in consequence,
christened “Bounding Bet” by the men, who
speedily sought cover whenever they saw a puff of smoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
from it. The deadly missile would go rolling and skipping
along the inside of the line of works, finally exploding;
one, that failed to burst, was opened and found to contain
480 copper balls of less than half an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>The sharp shooters were constantly engaged, and a
man could scarcely show his head above the breastworks,
at the more exposed points, without its being made a
target. On May 31st the Parrott gun in Battery 11
fired a few rounds at the fleet. Soon after this Co. K
was given a 24-pounder siege gun on the south side of
the works named, by the company that had formerly used
it, “Virginia,” and the Parrott was transferred to DeGournay’s
battalion.</p>

<p>On the 3d of June an election was held in Co. K to fill
the vacancy caused by the death of Lieut. Frank. N. K.
Adams received 37 votes, W. L. Ellis 7, scattering 4, and
Lieut. Adams was duly commissioned. Hot weather had
now set in, and this, coupled with constant exposure in
the trenches, caused much sickness among the troops;
camp fever, diarrhœa, chills and fever soon reduced the
number able to report for duty nearly one-third, and many
of Co. K were among the sick. The company now served
only at the artillery; Lieut. Pratt had charge of the
“Virginia,” on the south side of the fortifications, Lieut.
Tuttle had “The Baby,” brass rifle, at the Jackson Road,
Lieut. Adams remained at Battery No. 1, occasionally
relieving Lieuts. Pratt and Tuttle. Capt. Whitfield was
placed in command of the Batteries 1, 2, 3 and 5, manned
by detachments from Cos. K, A, G and B, respectively.
The detachments of Co. K, at the “Virginia” and “Baby,”
were daily relieved by the men held in reserve at Battery
No. 1. The fire of the enemy’s land batteries was now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
very annoying, and the Confederate artillery could not
fire a gun without having the fire of a dozen pieces concentrated
upon it. Co. K’s brass gun was in this way
several times silenced, and during the siege had two or
three sets of wheels cut down. Finally the artillerists
were compelled to withdraw their guns from the batteries
and only run them in when a charge was made. In a
measure to meet this emergency, the ten-inch Columbiad
in Battery No. 4, on the river, was turned around and
brought to bear by calculation on the batteries giving the
most annoyance, and fire opened, apparently with considerable
effect as the enemy’s fire slackened. Quite a
number of eight and nine-inch guns were landed from the
fleet, and placed in positions where they did much damage
to the Confederate works. A battery of seven of these
guns were located in front of Gen. Beale’s centre, one of
six guns to the right of the Jackson Road, in front of Co.
K’s brass gun, and one of seven guns in front of Col.
Steadman’s command. From all of these a constant fire
was kept up.</p>

<p>A singular phenomenon occurred on the night of June
13th; after a heavy cannonading an immense wave, at
least six feet in height, rushed up the river, and at the
same time Battery No. 6 caved into the river, one gun
being lost. Whether the wave caused the bluff to cave
in, or the bluff caving caused the wave, was a disputed
question in camp, the general opinion, however, was that
not a sufficient mass of earth fell to cause such a disturbance
of the river.</p>

<p>About 3 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> on the 11th, after a heavy bombardment,
the enemy made an attempt to storm the southeast angle
of the works, but were repulsed. On the morning of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
13th a tremendous bombardment was opened, and a show
of force was made. The firing then ceased and Gen.
Banks sent in a flag of truce, demanding the surrender of
the place. He complimented the garrison and commander
in high terms; their courage, he said, amounted
almost to heroism, but it was folly for them to attempt to
hold the place any longer, as it was at his will, and he
demanded the surrender in the name of humanity, to
prevent the sacrifice of lives, as it would be impossible to
save the garrison from being put to the sword when the
works should be carried by assault; his artillery was
equal to any in extent and efficiency, and his men outnumbered
the garrison five to one. Gen. Gardner simply
replied that his duty required him to defend the post.</p>

<p>Before day on the morning of June 14th the enemy’s
land batteries and the fleet opened fire with unusual
rapidity, and about daylight the assault began. From
the northeast angle to the Jackson Road the fighting was
the most severe; the line between these points was defended
by the First Mississippi and Forty-ninth Alabama
and three or four pieces of artillery, including Co. K’s
brass rifle at the Jackson Road. Gen. Banks’ plan of
attack was as follows: two regiments of sharp shooters
were ordered to advance as skirmishers, these were followed
by a regiment with hand grenades, while another
rolled up cotton bales to fill the ditch. Weitzel’s brigade
and two brigades commanded by Cols. Kimball and
Morgan, all under command of Gen. Weitzel, formed the
storming party. On the left of this command was Gen.
Emory’s division under command of Gen. Paine.</p>

<p>The Federals advanced, through their parallels, to
within three hundred yards, and then, under cover of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
dusk of the early morning and the smoke of their artillery,
formed their line of battle, and advanced to the assault,
in many places approaching to within ten feet of the
works. They were received, however, with so deadly a
fire of “buck and ball” that they were everywhere driven
back with heavy loss, or crouched in the ditch for
protection. By mere physical pressure of numbers some
got within the works, in front of the First Mississippi and
Forty-ninth Alabama regiments, but were instantly shot
down. Co. K’s brass rifle did good execution; Lieut.
Tuttle was in command and Sergt. Royals was gunner.
In the midst of a terrific shower of rifle balls, it was served
with coolness and deliberation. The enemy’s hand grenade
experiment proved an unfortunate one for the assailants, as
very few exploded when thrown in—they were percussion
grenades—but when thrown back by the Confederates,
from the slightly elevated works, into the midst of the
Federals below, they exploded, carrying death to their
former owners. The fight lasted, with great severity, for
about two hours, when the infantry fell back, but a heavy
artillery fire was kept up all day. About one hundred
prisoners were captured in the ditch near the Jackson
Road, being unable to retreat. Among the Federal
troops, who especially distinguished themselves here, were
the Eighth New Hampshire and Thirty-eighth Massachusetts
regiments. The fighting was very severe in front
of the First Alabama, but the enemy did not get so near
the works. On the right a feint was made, but the enemy
did not approach to within close musketry range. In
front of the 24-pounder, “Virginia,” manned by Co. K,
they approached near enough for shrapnel, and Lieut.
Pratt sent a few shell into their ranks, but they soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
withdrew. The enemy’s official report of the losses, was
203 killed, 1,401 wounded, 201 missing, total 1,805. Probably
many of those reported missing were killed, as there
were 260 Federal dead buried in front of the centre alone,
while the number of prisoners taken was but about 100.</p>

<p>After this repulse, Gen. Banks sent no flag of truce for
the purpose of burying the dead or removing the wounded
for three days. On the 17th Gen. Gardner sent out a
flag and requested the Federal commander to bury his
dead; but he replied that there were no dead to bury.
Gen. Beale, at Gen. Gardner’s request, then sent a flag to
Gen. Augur, who commanded in his front, calling his
attention to the unburied dead. Gen. Augur replied that
he did not think there were any there, but would grant a
cessation of hostilities to see. Parties of Confederates
were detailed to collect and pass over to the Federals
the dead near our lines, and, as above stated, 260 were
thus removed. Among the dead was found a wounded
officer—a Captain—who had been lying exposed to the
sun for three days without water, and was fly blown from
head to foot. At the close of the siege the writer was
informed that this man recovered. During the three days
many wounded must have perished on the field, as they
could be heard crying piteously for help. A Confederate,
more tender-hearted than Banks, was shot by the enemy
while carrying a canteen of water to a wounded Federal
who lay near the works. In front of Col. Steadman’s
position the dead were not buried, and their bodies could
seen from the breastworks, at the time of the surrender,
twenty-five days after the fight.</p>

<p>On June 15th Co. K removed a 42-pounder, smooth-bore,
barbette carriage, from Battery 2 or 3 to Battery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
No. 1, to replace the 24-pounder siege piece which had
been sent to the land defences.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the month, there was an
incessant fire of sharp shooters and artillery. To the left
of the Jackson Road, the enemy built up a tower of casks
filled with earth, two or three tiers in height, from which
their sharpshooters were able to over look the Confederate
works, and keep up an annoying fire. It was not
more than 60 yards from our lines, but the two or three
pieces of artillery which could be brought to bear on
it, were commanded by a score of the enemy’s heavy
guns, and could not be used to batter it down. At other
portions of the line the enemy rolled bales of cotton to
within close range, and surmounted them with sand-bags,
arranged with narrow loop-holes, for the sharpshooters.
On the 25th, Corp. L. H. Skelton, of Co. F, First Mississippi
regiment, crawled out and placed port-fires in the
bales of cotton and fired them; the first attempt failing,
he went out a second time and succeeded in burning a
number of bales. On the night of the 26th, 30 men made
a sortie near the southeast angle, spiked the guns of one
of the enemy’s batteries, and captured seven prisoners.</p>

<p>Co. K began about the last of June to make an excavation,
partially behind the Jackson Road redoubt, in
which to place their brass rifle, with a view of battering
down the sharp shooters’ tower. It was intended to be
so constructed as to be protected from the enemy’s artillery,
but as the work could only be done at night, it was
not completed in time to be of essential service. J.
McCarty was killed at the brass gun, on June 23d, by a
fragment of a shell. This was the last casualty in the
company during the siege.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>While these events were in progress in the centre, the
enemy had been busy, on the extreme right, preparing to
assault Battery No. 11, which was the key to the Confederate
works. They erected a battery containing 17
eight and nine-inch smooth bore guns and 20-pounder
Parrotts, on the opposite side of the ravine and distant only
150 yards. On the opposite bank of the river, Parrott
guns, manned by United States Regulars, were planted.
Lieut. Schurmer, of DeGournay’s battalion, was in command
of Battery 11, and its defense could have been entrusted
to no more gallant gentleman. Gen. D. H. Hill,
in a letter to the writer, said, “I knew Schurmer well at
Yorktown,” and in a subsequent number of his magazine
related the following incident connected with the siege of
that place, where Schurmer was under his command:
Schurmer was in charge of a 42-pounder, and especially
distinguished himself by the accuracy of his fire. It was
regarded as remarkable, even in the Federal army, and
one of the French princes, on McClellan’s staff, made
mention of it in a report of the operations at Yorktown.
When Yorktown was evacuated he remained in Fort
Magruder firing the 42-pounder all night, thus contributing
essentially to the deception of the enemy. He
attempted to escape the next morning on foot, but,
exhausted, fell asleep by the wayside and was captured.</p>

<p>In Battery No. 11 was the 30-pounder Parrott formerly
in Battery No. 1. On Friday morning, June 26th, the
fleet and land batteries opened a terrific fire on the earthwork,
and in a few minutes Co. K’s old gun was forever
silenced. One shell exploded in the muzzle, breaking off
about a foot of it, while the carriage was struck by five
or six shots and cut down. Three times during the day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the Confederate flag was shot away, falling outside the
works, and each time Schurmer, regardless of the storm
of shot and shell, replaced it. Without intermission by
day or night, the enemy kept up this fire until the 30th,
and under cover of it advanced their parallels down
through the ravine to within fifteen feet of the battery.
Gallant Schurmer never relaxed his heroic devotion to
duty, and on the 29th fell dead at his post. The next
day while the Confederates were rolling ten-inch shells
over the parapet into the enemy’s ditches, a storming
party of some two hundred men made a rush for the
battery. Its squad of defenders were hastily reinforced
and the assailants were driven out, leaving sixteen dead
inside our lines. On July 4th the Federal sappers were
driven out of their ditches by hand grenades, but they
claimed, after the surrender, that they had mined Battery
11 and had 3,000 pounds of powder under it ready to
explode had the siege been further prolonged. The
enemy’s batteries, on the west bank of the river, occasionally
opened but were always silenced by Batteries 3, 4
and 5. On the centre of the south side the enemy kept
quiet, and the detachment of Co. K, at the 24-pounder,
had but little to do. A few shots were fired on the 2d of
July.</p>

<p>At the northeast angle the enemy, during the latter
part of June and the first of July, were very busy
mining, but the Confederates were no less industrious.
An inner line of works extending across the angle was
thrown up, the enemy’s mine was countermined, and on
the 4th blown up. The enemy’s sappers were also constantly
annoyed by rolling ten-inch shells into their
ditches. On July 4th the enemy fired salutes from all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
their batteries with shotted guns, making it a warm day
within our lines.</p>

<p>On the night of the 6th, Co. K completed the sunken
redoubt for the brass rifle, and on the following morning
opened fire on the sharpshooters’ castle; but the embrasure
was incorrectly laid off, and the gun could not
be brought to bear on the tower without firing so close
to the side of the embrasure as to cause the earth to cave
in; so that, after firing three shots, the gun could no
longer be brought to bear on the mark. Owing to the
fire of the sharpshooters, nothing could be done to correct
the mistake till night. The necessary changes in
the earthwork were made that night, and on the morning
of the 8th the detachment was at the gun ready to
open fire, when the flag of truce was raised.</p>

<p>The condition of the garrison was now such as to
limit further resistance to a few days. Early in June
the enemy’s shells had fired the commissary building
and mill, destroying several thousand bushels of grain
and the chief means of grinding what was left. Fortunately,
the only locomotive of the Clinton and Port Hudson
Railroad was at Port Hudson. This was blocked up,
and furnished power to drive a portable mill. The corn,
with the exception of two or three days’ rations, held in
reserve for an emergency, failed the last of June, and the
supply of meat failed about the same time. There still
remained a considerable stock of field peas and mules.
When the men of the First Alabama were asked if they
would eat mule, they replied, “Yes; give us dog if necessary.”
The same spirit animated the whole garrison.
Mules were slaughtered, and the meat issued on the
29th or 30th of June; the peas were issued whole and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
also ground into meal. Those sick in camp and hospital
were fed by their comrades upon rats, daintily served
up as squirrels. In the pea diet there were some drawbacks;
the peas were stored in bulk on the floor of the
church, and the concussion of the bombardment had
broken in every pane of glass in the building. This, in
comminuted form, was mingled with the peas; and it
was no unusual incident to be made painfully aware of
its presence in masticating the peas. There were some
among the garrison who could not stomach the mule,
and, to satisfy these, an unexpected discovery was made
of sixty barrels of corn beef. Some wonder was expressed
as to this windfall, but it was accepted, eaten in
good faith and pronounced excellent. It was not until
after the surrender that those who ate it knew that it
was carefully corned mule.</p>

<p>The ammunition, although it had been economized,
was so nearly fired away that another general assault
would have exhausted the supply. Nearly every cannon
on the land fortifications had been disabled, and in
the river batteries there remained but nine or ten fit for
use.</p>

<p>On the first day of the siege there were 5,500 men
at the breastworks; some 600 had been killed and
wounded; many had died of disease, and at least 2,000
were suffering from camp-fever and diarrhœa, many
of them being unable, under any emergency, to fire a
musket.</p>

<p>This was the situation when, on the 7th of July, salutes
from the enemy’s batteries and fleet, and continued cheering
all along their lines, announced some great event.
The lines were so close that the garrison was not long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
kept in ignorance that Vicksburg had fallen. That night
Gen. Gardner summoned a council of war, consisting of
Gen. Beale, Cols. Steadman, Miles, Lyle and Shelby, and
Lieut.-Col. Marshal J. Smith. They decided unanimously
that it was impossible to hold out longer, inasmuch as
the provisions were nearly exhausted; of ammunition
there remained but twenty rounds per man, with a small
supply for the artillery; and a large proportion of the
garrison were sick or, from exhaustion, unfit for duty.
A communication was at once sent to Gen. Banks, stating
what had been heard in regard to the fall of Vicksburg,
asking for official information and notifying him
that, if the report was true, Gen. Gardner was ready to
negotiate for terms of surrender. Gen. Banks’ reply, enclosing
a despatch from Gen. Grant, announcing the fall
of Vicksburg, was received before day. Gen. Gardner at
once appointed Cols. Miles and Steadman and Lieut.-Col.
Smith commissioners to arrange terms of surrender. To
represent the Federals, Gen Banks appointed Brig.-Gen.
Chas. P. Stone, Brig.-Gen. Wm. Dwight and Col. Henry
M. Birge. The following terms were drawn up and
signed:—</p>

<p><i>Article I.</i>—Maj.-Gen. Frank Gardner surrenders to the
United States forces, under Maj.-Gen. Banks, the place
of Port Hudson and its dependencies, with its garrison,
armaments, munitions, public funds and materials of war,
in the condition, as nearly as may be, in which they were
at the hour of the cessation of hostilities, namely, 6
o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, July 8, 1863.</p>

<p><i>Article II.</i>—The surrender stipulated in Article I is
qualified by no condition save that the officers and enlisted
men comprising the garrison shall receive the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
treatment due to prisoners of war according to the
usages of civilized warfare.</p>

<p><i>Article III.</i>—All private property of officers and enlisted
men shall be respected, and left to the respective
owners.</p>

<p><i>Article IV.</i>—The position of Port Hudson shall be
occupied to-morrow at 7 o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, by the forces of
the United States, and its garrison received as prisoners
of war by such general officers of the United States service

formalities of rendition. The Confederate troops
will be drawn up in line, officers in their positions, the

<p>On the morning of the 9th, the garrison was formed in
line and two officers were sent, by Gen. Gardner, to conduct
in the Federal officer deputed to receive the surrender.
This was Gen. Andrews, who entered the lines
on the Clinton Road shortly after 7 o’clock. Gen.
Gardner met him at the right of the line and delivered
up his sword, saying, “General, I will now formally surrender
my command to you, and for that purpose will
give the command “Ground arms.” Gen. Andrews
replied, that he received Gen. Gardner’s sword, but
returned it to him for having maintained his defence so
gallantly. Meanwhile the Federal infantry moved in, and
the wings resting on the river cut off any attempt to
escape. A few officers and men, including Maj. Knox, of
the First Alabama, concealed themselves near the outer
lines, prior to the surrender, and the following night made
their escape. There were, all told, 6,233 prisoners surrendered,
but this included many non-effectives, such as
teamsters, commissary, quartermaster and ordnance employees.
At no time were there more than 5,500 muskets
at the works. There were also surrendered 5,000 stand
of firearms and 51 pieces of artillery, the latter including
a number of small cast-iron guns, not mounted, and a
number of disabled guns. The small number of muskets
surrendered is accounted for by the fact that many of the
soldiers threw their guns into the river or broke them.</p>

<p>The casualties in the First Alabama regiment during
the siege were as follows:</p>

<p class="hanging allsmcap">EXPERIENCES OF PAROLED PRISONERS OF WAR—A DISORGANIZED
REGIMENT—A HANDSOME TURNOUT—CLOSE
QUARTERS—A FAITHFUL SERVANT—PRESENT,
OR ACCOUNTED FOR—IN CAMP AT MERIDIAN.</p>

</div>

<p>During the negotiations for the surrender, Gen. Banks
refused to grant terms permitting the release of the prisoners
on parole, on the ground that orders from Washington
positively forbade it. On the day of surrender,
however, he suddenly changed his mind and decided to
parole all enlisted men, retaining the officers. Gen. Dick
Taylor’s capture of Brashear City, and his nearly successful
attack on Donaldsonville, threatening communication
with New Orleans, may have had some influence in causing
the change of purpose. Gen. Wirt Adams’ audacious
dash into Springfield Landing and his destruction of a
large amount of commissary supplies stored there, seriously
embarrassing the Federal commander in feeding
his own troops, also made the paroling of the prisoners
advisable. There is no doubt, however, that Gen. Banks
was influenced by an honest admiration of the gallantry
and fortitude of the garrison, and this was his avowed
reason for paroling them. Blanks were at once printed,
Private J. C. Rogers, of Co. K, acting as the printer, and
on Saturday, July 11th, the giving of the paroles began.</p>

<p>The paroling of the First Alabama was completed
Tuesday forenoon (the 14th), and in the afternoon the
regiment, with the exception of those in the hospitals,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
bade farewell to their officers and marched out of the
fortifications. Of Co. K, but one was left behind—James
Herndon, who died a few days later. Altogether, about
500 enlisted men of the garrison were left behind in the
hospitals, sick and wounded.</p>

<p>The regiment kept well together till they were fairly
outside the enemy’s lines, and then, in the absence of
the commissioned officers, all organization was at an
end. About eight miles from Port Hudson the main
body of the regiment encamped, but some of the men
marched on, and all through the night squads were
leaving. No attempt was made in the morning to keep
the men together. Maj. Knox, who escaped, and who
joined the regiment after it was outside Gen. Banks’
lines, rode forward to secure rations for the regiment,
but failed, and we did not see him again till we reached
Shubuta, where he made arrangements for our transportation
to Mobile.</p>

<p>Most of Co. K, and of the First Alabama, took the
direct road to Shubuta, a station on the Mobile and
Ohio Railroad. At Clinton, Privates J. H. Byrd and
A. J. White went to the hospital, where both died on
July 25th.</p>

<p>The writer can only give the experiences of a party of
eight, of which he was one, on the homeward trip, but
all probably fared about alike. Our party consisted of
Orderly Sergt. Cameron, Sergt. Fay, Corp. Blaylock,
Privates Bledsoe, Hurd, Lamar and Smith and a youth
named Dennis, who was with the company but not mustered
in. On the second day after leaving Port Hudson,
members of the squad purchased a horse, mule and Jersey
wagon, with which to carry our baggage and sick.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
The wagon had well-worn wooden axles which constantly
broke; the horse was sore back and skeletonized,
but the mule was a very fair animal. With this team we
left Clinton on the morning of the 16th, but just before
night halted for repairs, having made fifteen miles. On
Friday, the 17th, after the wagon had been overhauled
at the wayside smithy, we marched to Tangipahoa, eighteen
miles. Two of the party, with the wagon, left early
the next morning for Summit, Miss., while the others
remained at Clinton till Sunday afternoon, and then took
the train on the N. O. &amp; J. Railroad, arriving at Summit
at 9, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> So soon as we got off the Confederate cavalry
burned the train, to prevent it falling into the hands of
the enemy. The wagon detail arrived just before the
train, having broken down on the road, necessitating
the making of two axles. On Monday morning we
started due east for Monticello, and camped after marching
twenty-two miles. At 11, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, Tuesday, we reached
Monticello, where we found Gen. Logan’s command (Confederate)
crossing Pearl river. At Tangipahoa we drew
rations, and at Monticello Gen. Logan’s commissary honored
Sergt. Cameron’s requisition. From Monticello we
took the Williamsburg road through the piney woods,
scoring for the day twenty-one and one-half miles. Now
began daily skirmishes for something to eat, as those who
were ahead of us had cleaned the section adjoining the
road like a cloud of locusts—there was little left to beg,
buy or steal. On Wednesday we scored nineteen and
one-half miles, dining, for a consideration, with a probate
judge. A shower coming up, we stopped at dusk one
mile west of Williamsburg at a log cabin—one room and
a shed. The family consisted of a man, his wife, two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
sons and two daughters. The paroled soldiers who had
been passing for two days had nearly drained them of
everything, but they treated us very cordially, gave us
supper and breakfast of corn-bread and bacon, and spread
us a pallet of quilts across the floor in front of the fire.
With difficulty could they be induced to accept even a
trifling compensation. In addition to our party of eight,
there were three other soldiers. The lady (poor and ignorant,
she was a lady) occupied the shed room with her
two daughters, while the host, his two sons and eleven
guests slept in the main room. It was our experience all
along the route that, while there was no cause of complaint
against any, the poor were the more hospitable.
Friday night our party went supperless to our blankets
in a roadside camp.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon we arrived at Shubuta, where we
found collected a large number of the paroled prisoners
awaiting transportation. It was about midnight when the
train going south came along. As it was already full to
overflowing, those at Shubuta had to climb to the second
deck and take passage upon the roofs of the freight cars.
It was a ticklish position, but we lay down, secured ourselves
as best we could and went to sleep. At 9, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>,
Sunday, the train arrived at Mobile, and the smoke and
dust begrimed deck passengers of Co. K wandered down
to the river and performed ablutions in rain water collected
in a lot of iron salt-boilers lying on the wharf. At
1, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, we took the train for Montgomery, whence the
members of Co. K soon made their way home.</p>

<p>As illustrating the faithfulness of the negro, it is worthy
of record that Lamar’s colored boy Floyd, who was with
him at Port Hudson, and who soon after the surrender<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
was missing, was awaiting his master with a horse at
Washington Landing. He had got into a fight with a
Federal negro soldier, knocked him down and then fled,
fearing that he would be conscripted into the Federal
army, and had made his way home.</p>

<p>John Tarleton died on his way home, near Monticello.
Seven men, Jesse Adams, M. Deno, — Haley, M.
Hern, — Merritt, J. Schein and J. Shoals never afterwards
reported to the company: Jesse Adams was known
to have made his way to Mobile.</p>

<p>The other members of Co. K succeeded in getting to
their homes, where they remained, enjoying a well earned
furlough, until Oct. 12, 1863, when the First Alabama
was ordered to report at Cahawba, Ala.</p>

<p>Of Co. K, according to such imperfect records as the
writer has at his command, the following men reported at
Cahawba, or soon after at Meridian, Miss.: Orderly
Sergeant, Norman Cameron, J. L. Alexander, E. L. Averheart,
O. M. Blaylock, J. Boggan, T. M. Boggan, G. R.
Bledsoe, C. W. Brown, Wm. Douglass, Wm. Dubose,
George M. Durden, J. Durden, W. L. Ellis, W. H. Fay,
W. Farmer, Henry Fralick, P. G. Golsan, John Gorman,
John Griffin, J. Hamilton, J. C. Hearn, G. W. Hearn, E.
Hearn, Joseph Hurd, W. H. Hutchinson, E. Jenkins, J.
Killough, V. Kirkpatrick, M. D. Lamar, E. Leysath, J.
Lewis, G. F. Martin, J. W. May, Wm. Moncrief, J. Owens,
James D. Rice, Junius Robinson, C. H. Royals, G. H,
Royals, E. T. Sears, J. H. Shaver, J. L. Simpson, D. P.
Smith, A. C. Smyth, A. J. Thompson. John S. Tunnell,
Josiah Tunnell, Wm. Vaughn, John Williamson and T.
A. Wilson. J. J. Stuart and J. P. Tharp reported not very
long after, and R. H. Kirkpatrick was received as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
recruit, total 53. There were absent at the hospitals or
invalided: R. H. Callens, at Selma, and J. Hays, at Montgomery,
both of whom soon after died; S. Glenn, J. C.
Rogers, B. L. Scott and F. Wilkins, all of whom soon after
received discharges for disability. Clark had been transferred
to the navy during the summer.</p>

<p>The officers of Co. K, Capt. Whitfield and Lieuts. Pratt,
Tuttle and Adams, were taken by boat to New Orleans,
and quartered on Rampart street. Here they remained
till Sept. 20th. They were then transferred to Johnson’s
Island, Lake Erie, where they arrived on Oct. 1, 1863.
Lieut. Adams was exchanged in the spring of 1864, rejoining
his company in May. Lieut. Pratt was paroled
Sept. 16, 1864. Capt. Whitfield and Lieut. Tuttle remained
at Johnson’s Island till the close of the war.</p>

<p>Of the regiment 610 enlisted men reported at the Parole
Camp, and about 100 were absent, sick or unaccounted
for. Of the regimental officers Maj. Knox was the only
one present, the others being at Johnson’s Island. There
were about a dozen company officers present; each company,
with the exception of <i>K</i>, having one or more
representatives.</p>

<p>On Nov. 10th the regiment arrived at Meridian, Miss.,
having been assigned to Polk’s Corps, Army of the Mississippi,
Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, commanding. Some
of the non-commissioned officers of Co. K having requested
to be restored to the ranks, the following reorganization
was ordered: O. Sergt., Norman Cameron,
2d Sergt., Wm. H. Fay, 3d Sergt., C. Hardie Royals, 4th
Sergt., M. D. Lamar, 5th Sergt., D. P. Smith, Corporals,
E. L. Averhart, O. M. Blaylock, G. Hearn and J. D. Rice.</p>

<p>Lieut. Haley of Co. G was assigned to the command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
of Co. K, but was in a few weeks replaced by Lieut.
Johnson, of Co. F.</p>

<p>The regiment was armed with new Austrian rifles, and
the old routine of drill was once more resumed. Co. K
made rapid progress and was complimented by Maj.
Knox, by being excused from evening drill after Nov.
26th on account of its proficiency.</p>

<p>On Nov. 25th the regiment received two months’ pay
to April 30th, and on Dec. 4th, was paid to Oct. 31st, with
all arrearages, including $50 bounty and commutation for
clothing; about $125,000 was disbursed to the regiment
at this time. A limited amount of clothing was also
issued, and some shoes, but the latter were scarce, only
15 pairs to the regiment. Rations were of good quality,
and much more plentiful than ever afterwards, consisting
of corn meal and a little flour, beef, bacon, sweet potatoes,
salt, vinegar and soap. Early in November orders were
issued to build log barracks for winter quarters, 18 by 22
feet each designed for 25 men.</p>

<p>The regiment had been declared exchanged on Oct.
16th, but it was soon known in camp that the Federals
had denied the validity of the exchange, disputes having
arisen in regard to the cartel. In camp the subject was
discussed with much interest, especially the question what
would be our fate if recaptured by the enemy. Political
questions of the day now crept into our camp fire discussions,
especially the acts of the Confederate Congress
relative to the army. The act restricting furloughs and
other privileges and offering in lieu thereof increased pay,
also the act forcing men who had put in substitutes to
report for duty were subjects of debate, and the former
was bitterly denounced.</p>

</div>

<p>The First Alabama Regiment was not required to do
other duty than camp guard and drill until about the 1st
of December; three companies of the regiment were
then sent down the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to guard
the bridges, and heavy details were made from the remaining
companies—about 125 men daily—for provost
duty at Meridian. This made it necessary for the men
to go on duty every other day, and put an end to drilling.
It was very severe on the few commissioned officers
present, and their complaints finally led to the regiment
being relieved of a portion of the burden.</p>

<p>December passed without any event of particular interest.
On January 21, 1864, Cos. C, H and K were ordered
to Jackson, Miss., and on the following morning took the
cars, arriving at Jackson on the 23d. We went into
camp on the east bank of Pearl River, opposite the city.
Co. K had 33 men present for work. Shovels and picks
were issued, guns stacked, and on Sunday morning, the
24th, the detail began grading a road down the bluff.
The railroad bridge burned in the spring of 1863, not
having been rebuilt, the intention was to make a road,
so that locomotives and cars—of which there were a considerable
number west of Pearl River—could be ferried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
across the river. The bluff being a hard clay marl, the
progress was slow.</p>

<p>On February 3d, Gen. Sherman advanced from Vicksburg
with 30,000 men and 60 pieces of artillery. On the
4th orders were issued to the three companies of the
First Alabama to cook up three days’ rations, and they
were attached to the Tenth Texas Regiment, Ector’s Brigade,
French’s Division.</p>

<p>As the Federals entered Jackson at sundown on the
5th, the Confederates evacuated the town and took the
road to Brandon. The pontoon bridge was cut loose
and floated down the river. After marching twelve
miles, we halted till 4 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, when the retreat was resumed.
Passing through Brandon at sunrise, the battalion
took the road to Morton, where, on Sunday afternoon,
we took the cars for Meridian, arriving during the
night. The three companies stationed on the Mobile
and Ohio Railroad proceeded to Mobile without rejoining
the regiment, but the other companies remained at
Meridian until the 14th, except the sick, who were sent
with the regimental baggage to Demopolis by train on
the 12th. When Meridian was evacuated, on the 14th,
the First Alabama, owing to its excellent morale and
discipline, was selected to form the rear guard of the retreating
army. They marched to the Tombigbee River,
where the First Alabama took the boat for Mobile, arriving
on the 19th or 20th of February. Here the three
detached companies from the Mobile and Ohio Railroad
rejoined the command, and the regiment was, on
the 22d, sent to the land defences and given charge of
seven of the outer redans or forts. In two only of these
were guns mounted, and nearly all were incomplete. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
was thought that Mobile was Sherman’s objective point,
and a large force of negroes was at work on the outer
line of fortifications, the inner lines being complete.
Drilling, both in the heavy artillery and infantry school,
was at once resumed. Co. K was stationed at Redan E,
which was but just commenced. We remained here till
March 8th, when the danger of an attack from Sherman
having disappeared, the regiment was withdrawn from
the lines and encamped on an open square on Government
Street. The day following there was a heavy rain
which flooded the camp, and portions of Government
Street were knee-deep in water. In the tents the men
piled their knapsacks and blankets on benches and such
other articles of camp furniture as would keep them
above water.</p>

<p>Orders were received on Sunday, March 13th, to cook
up two days’ rations, and to be ready to march at 9, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>,
on Monday, for Alabama Port. It was 3, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, when the
regiment moved, and only nine miles were scored; but
on the following day a march of twenty miles brought us
to our destination. The Twenty-first Alabama was relieved,
and on Wednesday started for Mobile. Two companies
of the First Alabama were sent to Cedar Point to
man the batteries there, while the others did picket duty
along the coast and on Fowl River. The camp was on
the bay in a pine grove. The men were furnished with
tents, and were soon comfortably quartered. An abundance
of oysters could be had by dredging for them,
while at several of the picket posts the men could feast
on bivalves all day. Under such circumstances, the duty
imposed on the regiment was not regarded as onerous.</p>

<p>On the 25th of March four companies of the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
were ordered down the coast to repel a raid of the enemy.
It was necessary to collect all the cartridges from the
remaining four companies to fill the boxes of those
ordered away, as only twenty rounds per man had been
issued to the regiment since its return to duty, and there
was not a round in the ordnance wagon. Considering
that the regiment had been acting as rear-guard of Polk’s
army, and had been sent down the bay to do picket duty,
it was a remarkable state of affairs. The alarm proved a
false one, and the detachment returned. On the 26th
two companies were sent to Fort Powell; and on the
27th another company was ordered to Cedar Point,
making three at that post. Co. K remained at Alabama
Port. Lieut. Johnson, who had for sometime been in
command of Co. K, was, on the 27th, relieved by order
of Maj. Knox, by Lieut. Jones, of Co. I; this caused
great dissatisfaction, as the latter was not liked. In
a few days, however, he was furloughed, and Lieut.
Crymes, of Co. I, a most gallant and popular gentleman,
was placed in command. On the 1st of April our rations
were increased—the meat from 1¼ pounds per day to
1½, and the bacon from ⅓ of a pound to ½ pound.
The battalion of the regiment at Alabama Port was
ordered, on the morning of April 5th, to strike tents, and
at 8, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> started for Cedar Point, where a boat was in
waiting to convey seven companies of the regiment to
Fort Gaines, Dauphin Island, three being left at Fort
Powell and Cedar Point. Only one-half of the men could
be carried at one trip, and it was after dark when the
second boat-load was landed. In the allotment of the
guns of the fort to the regiment, Co. K fared badly; for
though it was one of the four companies that served as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
heavy artillery at Port Hudson, and the only company
that served exclusively as such during the siege, yet it
was sent to the flanking casemates, while green companies
were sent to the barbette guns. The Thirtieth
Louisiana Regiment was on duty at the fort on alternate
days with the first Alabama, but two companies of the
First were sent into the fort every night to man the guns.
About the only relief from the monotony of guard duty
was the arrival of blockade runners, one or two of which
came in each week. They would slip in quietly at night,
and in the morning their low grey hulls could be seen
lying under the guns of Fort Morgan.</p>

<p>On the 16th of April a scouting party of 100 men
landed from the enemy’s fleet on the western end of
Dauphin Island, but were driven to their boats by a
picket guard of ten men. The only other incident of our
stay at Fort Gaines was on April 20th, when the C. S.
gunboat “Gaines” ran out near Fort Morgan to practice
with her guns. About the same time a Federal war ship
began shelling a working party throwing up a battery
near Fort Morgan. The men crowded the ramparts in
the expectation of seeing a general engagement, as
rumors had been in circulation for some time that Fort
Morgan was to be bombarded; but quiet was soon
restored. Co. I rejoined the regiment from Cedar Point
on the 20th.</p>

<p>Fishing constituted the chief amusement of the men,
and they met with great success. There was a large
seine on the island, and with this wagon loads of fish
were caught; but those of the best quality were brought
in by the hook and line sportsmen—redfish, croakers,
sea bass, blue cat, sand mullet, drum and sheepshead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
being on their strings. The seine was a dragnet for all
kinds of monsters. On one occasion a sawfish 12 feet
10 inches long, and weighing 338 pounds, was caught;
the sword or saw was 2 feet 10 inches in length and from
4 to 6 inches broad. On another occasion an immense
sturgeon was hauled in; while among the smaller fry
were sting rays, horseshoe crabs, sea nettles, sea porcupines
and a variety of other curiosities. Porpoises were
gamboling in the bay nearly all the time, and in the
lagoons on the island were alligators.</p>

<p>May 3d, the regiment embarked on the steamboat
“C. W. Durrance” for Mobile, where it was quartered
in the State Press Warehouse. Co. I was sent to Dog
River on the 4th, and on the 5th the other companies
went to Pollard, Ala. Co. K was immediately ordered
back to Hall’s Landing on Tensas River, where it
arrived on the 7th. Co. C was ordered to Greenville,
and two companies were ordered to do picket duty on
the railroad to Pensacola. The camp of Co. K was
about one mile from Hall’s Landing, and there it remained
for two weeks. Lieut. Adams, who had been
exchanged, joined the company about May 20th. On
May 16th a number of officers and men were detailed
from the regiment to attend an artillery school in Mobile.
Of Co. K, Sergts. Cameron, Fay and Smith were selected.
They reported, but before the school was fairly organized
the regiment was ordered to North Georgia. The bill of
fare at the school is worth of preservation:—Breakfast,
rye coffee and corn bread (of unsifted meal); dinner,
corn bread and boiled bacon, except on three days out
often, when molasses was issued in lieu of bacon; supper,
corn bread and rice boiled in the pot liquor left at noon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
The order of exercises at the school was as follows:—Reveille,
5 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>; police, 5.10; drill in infantry and
artillery, 5.30 to 6.30; breakfast, 7; guard mounting,
7.45; studies and recitations, 8 to 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span>; dinner, 1 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>;
studies and recitations, 2 to 4.30; infantry and artillery
drill, 5 to 6; police, 6.10; dress parade, 6.30; supper, 7;
tattoo, 9; taps, 9.30.</p>

<p>The detail rejoined the company on the 23d, and on
the 24th the command took the cars for Montgomery;
the other companies started a day or two earlier. During
the six months that had elapsed since the company reassembled
it had lost a number of its members. W. H.
Hutchinson had been transferred to the cavalry, Wm.
Douglass, E. Jenkins and Henry Fralick to the navy,
and, as previously mentioned, Callens and Hays had died.
While at Mobile and en route to North Georgia, the following
recruits joined the company: A. D. Ellis, Autauga
Co., February, 1864; — Harvey, March, 1864;
George W. Gibbons, D. E. Holt and G. W. Hunt, Autauga
Co., May, 1864. In June, while in North Georgia,
the following recruits joined the company: A. G. Gresham,
N. Landers, W. M. Trammel, of Tallapoosa Co., and
Isaac Ward, Montgomery Co. Harvey, who joined the
company at Mobile to avoid being conscripted, deserted
before we left there. The writer called the attention of
the officer in command of the company to the suspicious
character of the man on the day that he enlisted, but there
was nothing on which to base charges, and no notice was
taken of the warning. Subsequent events demonstrated
the correctness of the suspicion that he was a spy. He
stated that he had been employed in the Mobile navy
yard, and he was evidently familiar with the construction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
of the ram “Tennessee,” as, in conversation, he explained
how she could be disabled. The rudder-chains, he said,
lay along the deck, protected only by a cast-iron shield,
and they could easily be shot away. A few months later
the “Tennessee”; was disabled in precisely the way he
predicted. Whether he conveyed to the enemy the information
of this weakness of an otherwise powerful
vessel is a matter of conjecture, but it is certainly a singular
coincidence.</p>

<p>The strength of Co. K at the beginning of the Tennessee
campaign, including the new recruits, was probably
about 62 men, of whom perhaps 40 were present for
duty. Lieut. N. K. Adams was in command.</p>

<p>The company arrived at Montgomery on the morning
of the 25th. A number of them who lived in Autauga
County received twelve hours’ furlough. The company
left Montgomery on the morning of the 26th, and rejoined
the regiment at New Hope Church, Saturday
morning, May 28th. Knapsacks and other <i>impedimenta</i>,
with the exception of blankets, were left in Montgomery.</p>

</div>

<p>The First Alabama Regiment, on its arrival in North
Georgia, was attached to Canty’s Brigade, but was soon
transferred to Quarles’ Brigade (Tennessee troops), Walthall’s
Division, Polk’s Corps. The regiment, excepting
Co. K, arrived in time to take part in the battle of New
Hope Church, on the 25th of May. When Co. K reported,
on the 28th, active skirmishing was in progress
along the entire line of Polk’s Corps, and during the next
few days the regiment lost a number of men, among them
being the Assistant Surgeon, Dr. Winnemore, who had
an eye shot out. To June 2d the loss was three killed
and eight wounded in the regiment.</p>

<p>On the night of June 1st the regiment was withdrawn
from the front to the reserve line, and on the following
night the New Hope line was abandoned. For several
days it had rained heavily, and the clay roads were badly
cut up. At 10, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, the regiment moved into the road
immediately in the rear of the artillery and wagon-train.
Every few hundred yards the wagons or guns would
stick in the mud, and the infantry would be brought to a
halt; but no opportunity was thus given for rest, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
road was liquid mud, and not even the musket could be
brought to an “order.” A drizzling rain added to the
discomfort of the men. At daylight on the morning of
the 3d we halted near the foot of Lost Mountain, having
marched five miles in seven hours. Fires were kindled,
a ration of whiskey distributed, and the men were allowed
to rest till after 12, noon, when the regiment was placed
in position. Breastworks were, as usual, at once constructed.
Privates A. D. Ellis, W. L. Ellis, John Griffin,
Joseph Hurd and John Williamson were detailed at this
time, with others of the regiment, to act, till further
orders, as sharpshooters. From Lost Mountain the
regiment moved to Pine Mountain, where it remained till
June 18th. Daily rains made life in the trenches almost
unendurable, and there was considerable sickness. Gen.
Johnston did all he could to alleviate the discomforts of
the soldiers; abundant rations of corn-bread were issued,
and occasionally a little genuine coffee. Meat was scarce
and of flour there was none.</p>

<p>On the night of the 18th of June the army fell back to
the Kennesaw line of defence, and on the 19th entrenched.
This night’s march, like that of the retreat from New
Hope, was one long to be remembered. The road was
ankle deep in mud and water, with occasional holes waist-deep,
full of thin mud. Into these the soldiers would
frequently stumble, requiring their comrades’ help to get
out. During the early part of the night there were
showers, and early next morning, as the soldiers filed up
the steep wooded slopes of Kennesaw, a heavy fog saturated
their clothing. By 10, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, a line of works had
been completed, and Co. K was then ordered to assist in
dragging two pieces of artillery to the top of Kennesaw.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
The detail of sharpshooters was at the foot of the mountain,
and was soon actively engaged skirmishing. On
the 20th the line was under a terrific artillery fire, and
A. D. Ellis, of Co. K, was seriously wounded by a fragment
of shell. He rejoined the company at Tuscumbia.
While stationed on Kennesaw, Sergt. Cameron performed
a notable act of bravery; during a heavy artillery fire a
shrapnel shell fell in the entrenchments amidst Co. K.
Sergt. Cameron, without an instant’s hesitation, seized the
smoking missile and hurled it outside the works ere it
exploded.</p>

<p>In the severe battle of June 27th, when Sherman attempted
to break the Confederate lines, the enemy charged
into the rifle-pits of Quarles’ brigade, but were repulsed.
Though under fire, the First Alabama was not closely
engaged in this battle; its loss was trifling, and in Co.
K there were no casualties. While on Kennesaw, Assistant-Surgeon
Madding, of the First Alabama, was killed
by a sharpshooter.</p>

<p>On the night of July 2d Gen. Johnston fell back from
Kennesaw to the line south of Marietta. A portion of Co.
K was on picket, but overtook the regiment without losing
a man. Sherman followed close in pursuit, and when
the new position was reached, no time was lost in entrenching.
In less than thirty minutes from the time the
First Alabama halted, the men had constructed temporary
breastworks and were ready and eager for the fray.
Sherman, however, finding Johnston prepared, contented
himself with shelling our lines. The fire of the enemy’s
sharpshooters was very annoying, and on the 4th, Corp.
James D. Rice was wounded by them. He rejoined the
company prior to the Tennessee campaign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>About 9 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> on the night of the 4th, the army again
retreated, the new line being that of the Chattahoochie
River. Breastworks were again constructed, and here
the regiment remained till another flank movement by
Sherman compelled Gen. Johnston, on the 9th, to cross
the river. The regiment was stationed on the line south
of Peach Tree Creek. While here, Lieut. Adams was
transferred to the Navy Department, Richmond; and an
election in the company, held by order of Maj. Knox,
resulted in the choice of Galvin Golsan as Second Lieutenant,
Jr. Orderly-Sergt. Cameron was also brevetted
First Lieutenant for gallantry, and, pending Lieut. Golsan’s
examination for a commission, was placed in command
of the company.</p>

<p>Gen. Hood took command of the army on July 19th.
By five o’clock on the morning of the 20th the sound of
musketry on the right announced the inauguration of the
new policy of aggressive instead of defensive warfare.
The regiment was at this time deployed as skirmishers
on Peach Tree Creek, three-quarters of a mile in front of
the works. Orders were received to retire as skirmishers,
and assemble on the main line. This was done
under a heavy artillery fire, in good order. The brigade
having, in the meantime, moved to the right, the regiment
followed at a double quick, overtaking it in position
on the reserve line immediately in the rear of the heaviest
fighting. No call was made on the reserve, and at the
close of the day the regiment returned to its former
position, but was marching and countermarching all that
night and the following day. On the night of the 21st
the regiment was withdrawn to Atlanta, and placed on
picket. Private Tharp was missing on the arrival of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
company at its new post, and was not again heard from.</p>

<p>The usual work of entrenching was immediately begun,
and in three hours everything was ready for an attack.
Late on the afternoon of the 22d the regiment was
ordered to the right to storm a twelve-gun battery; but
Hood’s attack had failed, and the order was countermanded
when the regiment was in position. It bivouacked
there for the night, and on the following morning returned
to its former position. Here it remained till
July 27, when it was withdrawn 300 yards to the rear for
rest. The same evening, however, the regiment was
ordered to fall in, with blankets rolled, ready for marching,
and it remained in line all night awaiting further
orders. It rained gently through the night, but when
morning came the clouds disappeared, and the sun rose
bright and clear—for the last time for many of the brave
men of the First Alabama.</p>

<p>About 10, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, came the command, “Attention!”
“Right face!” “Forward, march!” After marching
two or three miles, the command was halted till about 3,
<span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, when it was again ordered forward. Soon the
sound of musketry announced that a battle was in progress
immediately in front. Hood, with Stewart’s and
Lee’s corps, was attempting to break through the enemy’s
line near the Lickskillet, or Poorhouse Road. Gen.
Quarles at once placed his brigade in line of battle—the
First Alabama on the left, Co. K to the left of the color
company—Brevet-Lieut. Cameron in command, Lieut.
Golsan, who had not yet received his commission, accompanying
him. In a few minutes the brigade was under
fire, and, pressing forward, passed over Canty’s brigade,
which was lying down, and, crossing a rail fence, charged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
down a slope—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Into the jaws of death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the mouth of hell.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No sooner had they reached the foot of the hill,
crossed a small run or brook and begun to ascend the
opposite side, than a withering flanking fire swept down
their ranks; while from the works in front, halfway up
the ascent and hidden in the edge of the woods, streamed
forth a constant blaze of musketry, while shots from the
artillery pierced the bank of smoke like flashes of lightning.
Still the men made no halt, but, with heads bent
down as though breasting the cyclone, pressed onward,
till Gen. Quarles, seeing that none could survive to
reach the enemy’s lines, gave the order to halt and
fall back to the run, now red with blood, where a
slight cover was afforded. They were within fifty yards
of the enemy when halted, and a gallant soldier of
another command was buried by the enemy where he
fell just outside their works, and his grave, carefully protected,
was marked by them with a tribute to his bravery.
The charge was made over open ground, while the
enemy were wholly concealed in the woods and behind
a breastwork constructed of a rail fence and rock piled
up. Lieut. Golsan fell early in the fight, and Lieut.
Cameron just before reaching the run at the foot of the
hill. Both were cheering on the men when stricken
down. Co. K lost 19 men killed and wounded out of 32
engaged, the casualties being as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Killed—Brev. First Lieut. Norman Cameron; Junior
Second Lieut. Galvin Golsan; Privates William Dubose
and John Owens: total, 4.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>Mortally wounded—Privates A. C. Smyth, J. J. Stuart,
and A. J. Thompson: total, 3.</p>

<p>Seriously wounded—Sergt. M. D. Lamar; Privates
John Boggan, George Durden, E. Leysath, J. L. Simpson
and John Williamson: total, 6.</p>

<p>Severely wounded—Corpls. E. L. Averheart and O.
M. Blaylock; Private C. B. Brown: total, 3.</p>

<p>Slightly wounded (not sent to hospital)—Privates J. C.
Hearn, John Tunnell and J. H. Shaver: total, 3.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the regiment, 171 men, out of 325 present, were
killed and wounded, including 13 color-bearers. It was
not till about dark that the shattered remnant of the First
Alabama was withdrawn. The names of those of Co. K
who escaped unharmed from this terrible gorge are, to
the best of the writer’s knowledge—Sergt. W. H. Fay;
Corp. G. W. Hearn; Privates T. M. Boggan, W. L.
Ellis, W. W. Day, John Griffin, Joseph Hurd, G. W.
Hunt, R. H. Kirkpatrick, John Killough, Joseph May,
Eli T. Sears and Josiah Tunnell.</p>

<p>Of the wounded, Privates Smyth and Thomson lived
till they reached the hospital at Griffin, where both died.
There is some uncertainty in regard to J. J. Stuart’s fate,
several members of the company asserting positively that
he was mortally wounded in this battle, and died in
hospital; others, having equally good opportunities of
knowing the facts, being ignorant of his fate; and some
asserting that he was not present. His name does not
appear in a memoranda of the killed and wounded made
about ten days after the battle by the writer, who was
himself in Montgomery, Ala., at the time. Sergt. Lamar
received a bullet in the hip and was never able to return<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
to duty. Private Williamson received a bullet in the
shoulder, a second in the thigh, while a third chipped a
piece off of a front tooth. He, too, was permanently
disabled, as were Durden, Leysath and Simpson. The
others soon recovered of their wounds. For some days
doubt existed as to Lieut. Cameron’s death, but the
lingering hope was dispelled by a member of another
company, who saw him breathe his last. Lieut. Golsan’s
body was carried a little distance to the rear by some of
the company; but they had to leave him, and with the
other dead he was buried by the enemy. There was no
foundation whatever for the rumor, which reached his
home, that he was not killed.</p>

<p>Maj. Knox was seriously wounded, and the command
of the regiment devolved upon Capt. Williams. Sergt.
W. H. Fay was ordered to take command of Co. K.
The brigade bivouacked for the night near the battle-field,
and on the 29th returned to its former position on
the defences, and the regiment resumed picket duty.</p>

<p>While out on picket, August 3d, Co. K suffered
another great loss. Private Farmer was slightly
wounded, and expressing a desire for water, Sergt. Fay
volunteered to get some at a neighboring well. He took
several canteens, and succeeded in reaching the well in
safety; but on his return, while crossing an exposed
opening, a ball pierced his heart. He exclaimed, “Oh,
men! oh, men!” walked about fifteen steps and sat
down under the shade of a small tree; and as Sergt.
Royals, who ran to his assistance, caught him in his
arms, he struggled once or twice and died. Thus
perished, in the glory of early Christian manhood, one
of the pure and noble of earth. The company thus lost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
in less than one week two officers commanding, and
one who had been elected to command—three noble,
Christian men, Cameron, Golsan, and Fay.</p>

<p>On the death of Sergt. Fay, Sergt. C. H. Royals took
command, and held it till relieved by Lieut. Jones, of Co.
I. Private G. F. Martin was slightly wounded on the
4th. On the 12th of August Private D. E. Holt was
severely wounded, a Minie ball passing through both
thighs, but fortunately missing the larger blood-vessels
and bones. He was taken to the hospital, where gangrene
getting into the wound, he narrowly escaped
death, and was disabled from further service.</p>

<p>An election for Junior Second Lieutenant was held on
August 9th. John L. Alexander received 9 votes, and
Daniel P. Smith 10. Lieut. Smith soon after successfully
passed his examination for promotion, but did not
receive his commission till September 7th. John L.
Alexander was about this time made Orderly Sergeant.
Corpls. Averheart and Hearn were promoted to sergeantcies,
and Josiah Tunnell and G. H. Royals were
appointed corporals.</p>

<p>While at Atlanta, those of the soldiers who had any
money could purchase some few articles of luxury; rice
could be bought for 75 cents per pound, and flour for
50 cents per pound. The rations, as usual, consisted of
corn bread and beef.</p>

<p>On August 19th the regiment was ordered down the
railroad to intercept a raid, but went into camp in the
outskirts of Atlanta. Again, on the 21st, the regiment
was sent three or four miles to the right of the Confederate
lines, where it constructed an abattis. The
following day it was ordered back to its old position at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
the breastworks near the Chattanooga Railroad. On the
night of the 25th the Federals withdrew from around
Atlanta, moving to the south; and on the morning of
the 26th Gen. Stewart’s corps occupied the abandoned
works. The First Alabama, with other troops, advanced
to the Chattahoochie on a reconnaissance, without meeting
the enemy. In the afternoon the regiment was withdrawn,
and camped inside the city lines. Here we
remained until the morning of the 31st, when we were
ordered down the Macon Railroad towards East Point,
some four or five miles. During the day the regiment
was mustered for pay. Towards evening the command
returned to Atlanta, camping beside the Macon Railroad.
Early on the morning of Thursday, September 1, the
First Alabama was sent out on the Poorhouse or Lickskillet
road on picket, being stationed about half a mile
from the battle-field of July 28th. Rations of hard tack,
all that the men could carry, were here given out. Returning
to the city (leaving the picket line at 10.45 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>),
we found it evacuated with the exception of the cavalry
rear-guard. On an open square a huge pile of cotton was
fiercely blazing, while down the Macon Railroad heavy
explosions told of the destruction of an ammunition train
abandoned through the negligence of the Chief Quartermaster.
The First Alabama, which formed the infantry
portion of the rear-guard, made no halt in the city, but
took the road to McDonough, passing out of the city
limits about 1 or 2 o’clock on the morning of the 2d.
Except for brief intervals of rest, the march was continued
till noon on the 2d, when the command deployed and
built breastworks. Just as these were completed, orders
were received to take the road again. At 10.45, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
another halt was made, and the men were allowed to rest
till 2.30, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, Saturday, when they were ordered into
line, but no move was made till daylight. About 3, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>,
a halt was made four or five miles from Lovejoy’s Station.
Sunday morning, the 4th, the regiment marched four or
five miles, and deployed in a piece of thick woods.
Sharp firing could be heard in front, and occasionally a
cannon ball went crashing through the trees; but the
firing soon ceased, and the regiment went into camp.</p>

<p>There were twenty-two men present in Co. K when
the retreat from Atlanta began. Two or three, Private
Hurd among the number, broke down on the march, and
were sent to hospitals. Lieut. Jones, of Co. I, assigned
to the command of Co. K, was left behind in Atlanta, and
Lieut. Smith took command of the company on the night
of the 1st, though not commissioned till the 7th.</p>

</div>

<p>The First Alabama remained in camp at Lovejoy’s till
Sunday, September 18th, a camp-ground was cleared up
in the woods, and drilling was resumed. During the
Atlanta campaign the cooking was done at the wagon-yards;
now, cooking utensils were issued, and the men
were enabled to have comparatively decent fare. W. L.
Ellis was detailed to go to Montgomery after the company’s
knapsacks, and also to procure clothing from home
for the men. On the afternoon of the day he left orders
were received to cook up two days’ rations, and at noon
on the 18th the command broke camp and marched to
Fayetteville, a distance of ten miles. At 2 o’clock Monday
morning the reveille sounded, but it was 5.30, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>,
before the march was resumed. At dark the regiment
bivouacked three miles beyond Palmetto, having marched
eighteen miles.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, after a march of five miles, the command
was deployed and orders given to entrench. The position
was four or five miles from the Chattahoochie and
about twenty-five miles from Atlanta. While camped
near Palmetto, on Monday morning, September 26th,
President Davis informally reviewed the army, being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
greeted along portions of the line by cries of “Give us
Johnston!”</p>

<p>Thursday, September 29th, the command again received
orders to march. Private W. L. Ellis arrived that
morning with the company baggage and boxes from
home, and a hasty distribution had to be made of the
contents of the latter. Clean clothing from the knapsacks
was donned, the baggage repacked and sent into
Palmetto to a private house for storage; it was never
seen again.</p>

<p>At noon the command started, crossing the Chattahoochie
that evening on a pontoon bridge at the Pumpkintown,
or Phillips, Ferry, and going into camp after a
march of eight miles. It was showery on the 30th, but
a march of ten miles was made on the Powder Springs
Road. October set in stormy, the rain falling all day
and night, the command remaining in camp. A march
of twelve miles on Sunday, the 2d, brought the regiment
to familiar scenes, and it bivouacked three miles from
Lost Mountain. The troops recognized their old battlegrounds,
and there was no little enthusiasm aroused.
After a march of ten miles on the 3d, the command
struck the railroad at Big Shanty Station, which was
captured, with a few prisoners, after a slight skirmish.</p>

<p>Our division (Walthall’s) was deployed along the track,
which was torn up, ties piled and burned, and the rails—heated
red hot—bent. This work continued till 3 o’clock
on the morning of the 4th. After a few hours’ rest, the
division moved up the road, tearing up the track and
burning the ties. At noon, tired and hungry—being
without rations—the regiment took the road towards
Lost Mountain, and went on picket five miles from Big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Shanty Station. A march of seven miles was made on
the 5th, and just at dark the brigade began the ascent of
Lost Mountain, the regiment going on picket near the
top. The mountain side was thickly carpeted with
prickly pear, and falls and ejaculations more forcible
than pious were frequent. On the 6th the command
marched twelve miles, passing the site of New Hope
Church.</p>

<p>Near New Hope, French’s shattered division, repulsed
the previous day at Allatoona Bridge, was met. Gen.
French’s assault on the fort at Allatoona was of the
most desperate character, and resulted in placing half
his command <i>hors du combat</i>. Gen. Sherman, marching
to the relief of the beleaguered garrison, signaled from
the top of Kennesaw Mountain to its commander that
despatch made memorable by Bliss’s hymn:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hold the fort, I am coming.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">W. T. Sherman.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>The arrival of the Federal troops forced the Confederates
to retire just as they were about to reap the fruit of
their tremendous sacrifices.</p>

<p>Thus far it had rained every day since the army left
Palmetto, but the 7th was pleasant, the roads were good,
and a march of fifteen miles was made towards Van Wirt.
Another march of fifteen miles on the 8th brought the
regiment to Cedartown. This ended Hood’s first raid on
the railroad; ten or twelve miles of track had been torn
up, and about 400 prisoners taken. The First Alabama
did not load their guns. Co. K lost one man—Sergt.
George Hearn—who was barefoot, and on the night that
the regiment ascended Lost Mountain was left behind,
captured, and sent to Rock Island, Ill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>At noon on the 9th orders were received to march; the
left wing of the First Alabama, including Co. K, was the
brigade rear guard, and did not get into camp until 10.30,
<span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, after a march of twelve miles. On the 10th the
Coosa River was crossed at Coosaville, on a pontoon
bridge, the day’s progress being ten or twelve miles.
Eighteen miles were scored on the 11th, on the Dirt-town
road, and on the 12th over twenty miles, the regiment
camping at 9, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, three miles from Resaca. Soon after
bivouacking it began to rain. An attack on Resaca having
failed, that post was flanked, and the railroad struck at
Tilton at noon on the 13th, which post surrendered to
Gen. French. The track was torn up all the way to
Dalton, the ties burned, and rails bent. Dalton surrendered
to Gen. Cheatham with about 1,000 prisoners without
a fight. The First Alabama did good service tearing
up track, and camped that night two miles south of Dalton.
On the 14th Rocky Face Mountain was crossed at Dug
Gap, and after marching twelve miles the regiment went
into camp. The route on the 15th lay through the
Chattooga Valley for eighteen miles. Passing through
Treadwell Gap and across Chattooga River, the regiment,
after a march of ten miles, bivouacked on the evening of
the 16th, two miles beyond Summerville, Ga.</p>

<p>The second raid resulted in the capture of about 1,500
or 2,000 prisoners and the destruction of twenty miles of
railroad track. Co. K had no more stragglers, but the
men were weary and footsore, having, since leaving
Palmetto, marched some two hundred miles in seventeen
days.</p>

<p>On the 17th, at 2, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, the command again broke camp,
and marching ten miles halted for the day at sunrise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
The army crossed the state line of Alabama on the 18th,
passed through Gaylesville, and camped three miles beyond,
having marched fifteen miles. Fifteen miles were
scored again on the 19th, the route taking us past the
Round Mountain Iron Works, in Cherokee County.
Reveille sounded at an early hour on the 20th, and by 3,
<span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, the regiment was on the road; twenty miles were
made by 2, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, when we camped five miles beyond
Gadsden. A welcome rest of forty-four hours was here
allowed the soldiers, and on the 21st some clothing was
issued to those most in need. Another treat was the
distribution of a large army mail, the accumulation of
two weeks or more. The order to march was given at
3, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, on the 22d, but it was countermanded before we
had gone three hundred yards, and it was 10, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, before
the final start was made; fifteen miles were, however,
accomplished before camping, the route being over Lookout
Mountain. The army crossed the Black Warrior
River on the 23d, and, passing through Brooksville, added
seventeen miles to the march record. Though the road
was very rocky, a march of seventeen miles was also
made on the 24th; the town of Summit was the only
point of interest. On the 25th the regiment marched
thirteen miles to Somerville, and on the 26th thirteen
miles to the lines around Decatur, a total of one hundred
and thirty-five miles in ten days, including two days’ rest
at Gadsden.</p>

<p>A brisk cannonade was in progress when the regiment
arrived, and it was at once ordered to the picket line. It
had been raining at intervals all day, and the night closed
in cold and gloomy. When the picket line was reached
it was quite dark. At 10, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, an order was received to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
advance the line one hundred and fifty yards and dig
rifle pits. It was impossible to see more than five feet in
any direction, and as the command was deployed as
skirmishers, the movement was executed with considerable
difficulty, but the new line was at last formed.
About the time the rifle pits were completed, the men
supplementing the few entrenching tools with tin-cups
and pans, the rain came pouring down, filling the pits
and converting the whole ground into a marsh. The men
were so exhausted that so soon as the rain had ceased
and they had bailed out the pits all but those on guard
lay down in the mud and fell asleep.</p>

<p>At daylight skirmishers were ordered forward, but
finding the enemy in force they fell back to the picket
line with a loss of one man mortally wounded in Co. E.
Soon after daylight the regiment was relieved and rejoined
the brigade. It rained at intervals all day, and to add to
the discomfort of the soldiers no rations were issued
except a little beef; there was no bread for two or three
days. At this time began the private foraging, which
later proved so disastrous to the discipline of the army.</p>

<p>On the morning of October 29, the regiment left Decatur
and marched sixteen miles westward, along the
Memphis and Charleston Railroad, camping three miles
east of Courtland. The line of march on the 30th was
through a level, fertile country, but desolated by Federal
raids, nearly every plantation building having been
burned. We camped that night at Leedam, having
marched fifteen miles and passed during the day through
Courtland and Jonesboro. On the 31st a march of ten
miles brought the regiment to Tuscumbia. The march
record from September 29th now footed up three hundred
and eighty-five miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>For several days after arriving at Tuscumbia it was
rainy; it then cleared off cold. On Sunday, November
6th, there was a general review and inspection, and on
the 12th Gen. Beauregard reviewed the army, which, at
that time, was said to number about 30,500 men. In
Stewart’s Corps there were 9,000 men. Corp. Rice and
Privates A. D. Ellis and J. W. May rejoined the company
on November 2d, and Junius Robinson on the 4th,
making a total of 20 muskets. Our number was reduced
by several sick sent to the rear before we crossed
the Tennessee.</p>

<p>Monday, November 14th, the regiment marched to
Florence and went into camp, and on the 18th received
several months’ pay, the first since leaving Meridian. At
this muster there were present Lieut. Smith, O. Sergt. J.
L. Alexander, Sergts. C. H. Royals and E. L. Averheart,
Corps. J. D. Rice and Josiah Tunnell, and Privates T. M.
Boggan, C. W. Brown, W. W. Day, A. D. Ellis, W. L.
Ellis, E. Hearn, J. C. Hearn, J. Killough, J. W. May, G.
F. Martin, Wm. Moncrief and John Tunnell. Private
Martin, during the entire campaign, was detailed at the
wagon camp as cook.</p>

<p>One great want of the army when it started on this
campaign in the depth of winter was that of shoes. At
the outset there were not a few who had but apologies
for shoes, and when Hood reached the Tennessee River
on his retreat, no less than 3,000 barefooted men straggled
in the rear, literally leaving a trail of blood along
the frozen pikes. The lack of rations was another serious
misfortune; for a month prior to entering upon the campaign
the troops had been on short rations of a miserable
quality. Three-quarters of a pound of very coarse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
cornmeal and one pound of fresh beef, bone and all—and
generally the bone predominated—nominally constituted
a day’s rations. These rations were issued at the wagon-yards
or camps, where details from the companies cooked
them. The beef was boiled and the meal, wet up with
cold water and made into “pones,” was browned—not
cooked—in “Dutch ovens.” Thus prepared, the food
was distributed—company commissioned officers and men
sharing alike—the bread, three days’ rations at a time,
the beef every day. By the time it reached the company
the ration had so “shrunk in the pot” that the writer
has seen a lean and lank Confederate dispose of his three
days’ rations of bread and one of beef at one sitting.
All the army had chronic diarrhœa, and all were hungry.
As a consequence of this latter fact, when the rich fields
of Tennessee—the “land of hog and hominy”—were
reached, no discipline could restrain the men, and thousands
at a time were scattered through the country
searching for something to satisfy their hunger. Company
officers, themselves half-starved, sympathized with
their men, and would not have punished them for foraging
had it been possible; but what punishment could be inflicted
upon men who were marching from early morn
till night? “Mud Lark,” as skinned hog meat was
called by the soldiers—who even in their suffering still
indulged in jokes—was brought in every night; six hundred
pounds was captured one night by the foragers of
the “First.” The Regimental Commissary, who was on
the lookout, seized it and compelled a <i>pro rata</i> distribution;
but no other notice was taken of the offence.
Parched corn augmented the scanty ration of bread,
and, after marching all day, half the night would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
spent by the hungry men in cooking up what had been
gathered along the road or after camping.</p>

<p>In spite of the many hardships which our company
had endured, the men, when they crossed the Tennessee,
marching northward, were cheerful and willing for any
duty or danger, and this was the spirit in the regiment
and army.</p>

<p>A commander never uttered a more unfounded libel
against his soldiers than Gen. Hood when he published
that his troops were demoralized and could not be trusted
in battle. Even when his half-starved legions left one-fourth
their number on the battle-field of Franklin, after
fighting for hours against a superior force, strongly entrenched,
and at one time penetrating the enemy’s line,
he was not satisfied, but is reported to have said, in private
conversation, that if his old Texas brigade had been with
him he would have won the battle. In his book, however,
he gave the troops who fought at Franklin a scanty
meed of praise.</p>

</div>

<p>It was raining slowly as, on Sunday, November 20,
the First Alabama formed and marched down to the
Tennessee river, crossed the long pontoon bridge, and
went into camp four miles beyond. Monday, there was
a light fall of snow, and the command advanced but
seven miles. At night it turned off very cold, and
Tuesday morning the roads were frozen hard. During
the day the army crossed the State line of Tennessee,
marked by a rough board sign placed by the roadside,
every regiment cheering heartily, Tennessee troops being
especially enthusiastic. The day’s march was thirteen
miles. Wednesday saw us twelve miles on our journey.
The day was cold and wintry, and the soldiers, thinly
clad and generally without overcoats, suffered keenly.
It was slightly warmer on Thursday. As on Wednesday,
the route lay through a hostile, mountainous country,
and the slow progress made by the artillery and wagon
trains, as well as the necessity of keeping the men well
closed up, delayed the army, and only twelve miles were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
made. The mountaineers were mostly Union men, and
showed no mercy to stragglers, either killing them outright
or horribly maltreating them. On Friday the roads
were better; the mountains were behind us; and as the
troops passed through Henryville they were met with
friendly greetings. The First Alabama went into camp
two miles beyond Henryville, having marched fifteen
miles, the best score since crossing the river. Saturday,
the people were still more cordial, and the troops were
cheered at Mount Pleasant. Sixteen miles had been
tramped when the First went into camp eight miles from
Columbia. On Sunday, the 27th, Stewart’s corps arrived
at Columbia, invested by Lee’s corps the preceding day.
At dusk the First Alabama were sent to the skirmish
line. During the night the enemy evacuated the town,
taking position on the other side of Duck River. The
regiment remained in camp Monday. Gen. Forrest
crossed four miles above Columbia on that day; and, a
pontoon bridge having been put down, Cheatham’s and
Stewart’s corps and Johnson’s division of Lee’s corps
followed on the 29th. Schofield at once withdrew, and
now began a spirited race for Franklin on parallel roads,
the Federals having the advantage of holding the regular
pike, while the Confederates marched over rough by-roads
and through the fields. There was brisk skirmishing
throughout the day between the flankers; but Cheatham,
who had forged far enough ahead to have thrown his
corps across the pike, failed to execute Hood’s positive
orders to do so. Hood then ordered Stewart’s corps to
the front to make the attack, but by the time they got up
it was dark, and the men could not be got into proper
position to ensure success. The two corps bivouacked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
at Spring Hill, and Schofield’s army, unmolested, filed by
so near that their wagons could be heard on the stony
pike. This blunder lost Hood the Tennessee campaign.
Gen. Hood states that Gen. Cheatham afterwards magnanimously
acknowledged his error. Even Hood did
not place any blame upon the army for this failure to
attack. The soldiers were greatly fatigued after the
twenty miles’ march of the day; but would have gallantly
responded to the order to attack, and themselves
wondered why it was not given.</p>

<p>On the morning of November 30th the race was renewed,
but Schofield had the advantage of being ahead
of his foes. He was so hardly pushed, however, that he
was obliged to sacrifice a considerable portion of his
wagon train, overturning and burning the wagons or
cutting down the wheels, and shooting the animals whenever
they blocked the retreat of the infantry. In some
cases whole teams could be seen lying dead in the traces.
At another point a quartermaster’s wagon had been overturned,
and for rods around the road and fields were
strewn with blankets. About noon, when four miles south
of Franklin, the Federal cavalry deployed along a wooded
crest running at right angles to the Columbia pike, and
covered the wearied infantry while filing into the entrenchments
at Franklin.</p>

<p>These entrenchments had been carefully constructed,
and had already received their baptism of blood the year
prior (April 10, 1863), when Gen. Van Dorn attacked
Gen. Granger and was repulsed. The inner line was a
regularly constructed earthwork, with a ditch on the
outside about three feet deep and five feet wide. From
the bottom of the ditch to the top of the parapet was at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
least six or seven feet. Heavy timbers or head logs
crowned the top of the parapet, space being left between
the logs and earth to allow the soldiers to fire. An
abattis of black locust protected the front. Two hundred
and fifty or three hundred yards in front of this—an
open field with gentle slope intervening—was another
connected line of earthworks, made by digging a ditch
about eighteen inches or two feet in depth, and throwing
the earth to the front. Outside of this, again, were detached
rifle pits. This was the nature of the works on
each side the Columbia pike, where the heaviest fighting
took place. The works extended around Franklin in a
semi-circle, touching Big Harpeth River above and below
the town, a length of a mile and a half.</p>

<p>As Stewart’s corps, which was in the advance, came
up, the Federal cavalry also withdrew into Franklin.
The Confederate forces rapidly deployed, Stewart’s corps
forming the right and Cheatham’s the left, Johnston’s
division of Lee’s corps being still in the rear. Stewart’s
corps was formed in line of battle between the Nashville
and Decatur Railroad and the Lewisburg pike, about one
and a quarter miles from Franklin and three-quarters of
a mile from the Union lines. The corps was so fronted
that an advance would take it across the railroad, striking
the enemy’s main line near the Columbia pike. Walthall’s
division was in the centre, with Quarles’ brigade on the
right. In front of Walthall was a deep cut in the railroad,
which was not discovered till the advance had
begun, and which necessitated his moving by the left flank,
as subsequently stated, to avoid the obstacle. Much
straggling had been caused by the forced marches of the
two preceding days, and probably not over 15,000 or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
16,000 men of Stewart’s and Cheatham’s corps were
engaged in the battle, and Johnston’s division, say 2,000
or 3,000 men, did not take part till the main attack had
failed, about 7, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> The artillery, with the exception of
a section of two Napoleon guns, did not participate in
the battle. Forrest’s cavalry was held in reserve on the
flanks, Gen. Forrest himself being with the infantry
during the charge.</p>

<p>Gen. Schofield’s force was composed of the Fourth
Corps, which was officially reported ten days after the
battle to have numbered 14,172 men, the Twenty-third
Corps, 10,207 men, and the Forty-fourth Missouri and
Seventy-second Illinois unassigned. A Federal officer
present stated that they had more men than could stand
at the works, the lines being in some places six deep,
those in rear loading for those in front.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Confederate troops, while not enthusiastic,
was good. While waiting the completion of the
formation, the men of the regiments first in line were
quietly discussing the probable issue of the impending
battle; some with an eye to the future were picking white
beans from the dead vines in a field in our front; others,
no less industrious, were eating every crumb in their
haversacks. Among the latter was poor Brown of Co. K,
who, on being remonstrated with for his imprudence,
replied that he would be killed; his forebodings proved
too correct; one hour later he was dead.</p>

<p>About half-past three the command “Attention!” ran
quietly along Stewart’s lines; a detail was ordered to the
front to throw down a rail fence, and then came the
orders “Forward!” “Double quick!” For two hundred
yards the advance was through a corn-field, the dead stalks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
of which, of giant dimensions, were crossed and interlaced
in every direction. When the farther side of the field
was reached the command was halted, moved by the flank
to the left, and the alignment corrected. The enemy’s
works were now in full view, and not over a half mile
distant. Immediately in the front of the First Alabama
there was a valley with a small stream of water at the
bottom, the descent and ascent on the other side being
quite sharp. An open grove of sugar maples, entirely
free of underbrush, extended to the Federal rifle pits.
Away to the right the rattle of musketry showed that the
battle had begun, and the order, “Skirmishers to the
front!” almost immediately followed. The latter moved
rapidly forward, availing themselves of the cover of the
large maples and firing slowly as they advanced. As yet
not a bullet had whistled by us, and it was hard to realize
that it was more than a skirmish drill, with such precision
did the men move.</p>

<p>By the time the skirmishers were fifty yards away there
came the orders, “Forward! Double quick!” Down the
hill, across the brook, up the slope, over the railroad; then
came the first deadly Yankee greeting—a shrapnel bursting
in the ranks of Co. E, killing and wounding nine men.
In three minutes more the space was covered, the Confederates
were past the rifle pits and in the outer line of the
enemy’s works. Most of the Federals occupying them
surrendered and were sent to the rear; many of those
who tried to run back to the main line were shot down.</p>

<p>For an instant the line was halted and the men lay
down in the captured works. Not a stump nor a stone
obstructed the open field, on the farther side of which,
behind their entrenchments, lay the main body of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
enemy. To the right the roll of musketry was unintermitted,
but immediately in our front, except from the
Federal artillery, there was a momentary lull. It was but
for a moment, then the order “Forward!” was repeated
down the line. The men sprang to their feet, for the first
time in the battle gave the “rebel yell,” and dashed forward,
corps, division, and brigade officers leading in the
assault. At the same instant a sheet of smoke shot out
from the earthworks in front, thickening, as volley after
volley poured forth, into a great white bank, but broken
every moment by tongues of flame from the cannon.
Looming up above the smoke in shadowy form, like some
old tower, just inside the enemy’s works, were the huge
timbers of a cotton-press; this was the only landmark;
all else was hidden. But few shots were fired by the
Confederates as they dashed forward, for, though there
were no orders, each man instinctively felt that this was
to be a struggle man to man. Two Napoleon guns, run
forward by hand on the Columbia pike, kept well up with
the line of battle and were fired steadily. No other
artillery on the Confederate side fired a shot. The roar
of the Federal musketry was something never to be forgotten;
not even the Napoleons, nor the siege guns, firing
from the fort on the other side of the river, could be heard
distinct from that terrific volume of sound; yet the Confederates
moved forward towards this death-dealing bank
of smoke with all the precision of battalion drill. At the
distance of forty yards from the works the Confederate
line was unbroken and had suffered comparatively little
loss. The effect of this solid, steady charge was such
that Federal officers afterwards acknowledged that they
could with difficulty keep their men from going to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
rear. When within forty yards the enemy’s fire began to
tell, and the Confederates fell rapidly. The enemy fired
remarkably low, due, it is said, to their simply laying
their muskets on the slope of the parapet and pulling the
trigger without exposing themselves to take aim. At
last the ditch was reached; some of the assailants dashed
through the embrasures of the battery; others tried to
clamber over the parapet, and others exchanged shots
with the Federals under the head logs. Men were brained
with butts of muskets or bayonetted on the parapet, while
the flanking fire of the angles soon filled the ditch with
the dead and dying; a few got inside of the works unscathed
and were taken prisoners. Just to the left of the
pike the Confederates broke the Federal line, and for a
short time held one of their batteries, but the Federal
reserve charged, and after a desperate struggle regained
possession. This was the situation at dark: the opposing
forces confronting one another, with but a bank of earth
between, like two stags of the forest head to head and
antlers locked. Johnston’s division coming up at 7,
<span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, made a gallant effort to turn the evenly-balanced
scale, but only added to Hood’s already appalling losses.
About 9, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, the firing slackened and the roar of musketry
gradually died away, but was renewed at intervals
as one or the other side perceived or suspected some
movement of its foe.</p>

<p>So soon as the Federals were satisfied that the assault
was over, they commenced quietly to withdraw, and by
3 o’clock the next morning they were safely across the
river.</p>

<p>Daylight revealed to the Confederates their fearful loss;
in front of some portions of the works the ground was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
covered with the dead. Report at the time placed the
Confederate loss at 1,500 killed and 3,000 wounded.
Hood, in his despatches from the battle-field, gave his
loss at 4,500 killed, wounded and prisoners, the last being
estimated at 1,000. Swinton, the historian, gives the
Confederate loss as 1,739 killed, 3,850 wounded and 702
prisoners; total, 6,201. This would, in a measure, agree
with Hood’s own statement in “Advance and Retreat,”
where he places his total losses from all causes, from
November 6th to December 10th, 7,547; this includes
the losses at Columbia and in Forrest’s skirmishes. It
will thus be seen that nearly one-third of those engaged
were killed and wounded, and that one-tenth were killed.
Probably there never was a battle fought on the American
continent, between civilized armies, where the slaughter
was so great as in Hood’s army. The Federals reported
their loss at 189 killed, 1,033 wounded and 1,104
prisoners; total, 2,326. Their report of killed is, in the
writer’s opinion, understated, though the total may be
correct. It was reported at the time that 300 Federal
dead lay in the rear of the centre, where the heaviest
fighting took place.</p>

<p>The casualties among the Confederate general officers
were unparalleled, and their reckless exposure of their
lives was the general subject of comment in the army.
Nearly all went into the charge mounted, and Gens. Cleburne
and Adams were killed while trying to spur their
horses over the breastworks. Maj.-Gen. P. R. Cleburne
and Brig.-Gens. Gist, John Adams, Strahl and Granberry
were killed; Maj.-Gen. Brown and Brig.-Gens. Carter,
Marrigault, Quarles, Cockrell and Scott wounded, and
Brig.-Gen. Gordon was captured. Of Gen. Quarles’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
staff all were killed and wounded but the General’s son,
a lad of fourteen, who seized the brigade flag when the
color-bearer fell, and bore it inside the enemy’s works.
Dismounted in the melee, he tore the flag from the staff,
concealed it under his coat and got safely out with it.</p>

<p>Of Co. K, eleven men went into the charge; of these,
two were killed, four wounded and two taken prisoners.
Private C. W. Brown was shot through the heart, Private
J. W. May was killed on breastworks by the butt of a
musket, Lieut. Smith received a ball in the face, breaking
the lower jaw, when near the main line of the enemy;
Sergt. C. H. Royals was shot in the knee in the ditch
and captured, but left behind when the enemy retreated;
Serg. Averheart was wounded in the abdomen by a pistol
bullet; Corp. Tunnell was shot through one thigh and
across the other; Private W. L. Ellis was captured in
the ditch, and Private J. C. Hearn sprang through the
embrasure of the battery and was captured inside the
enemy’s lines. He relates that he placed his hand on the
12-pounder as he went in, and that it was so hot that it
burned him. Corp. Rice and Privates A. D. Ellis and
John Killough escaped unhurt. Of the members of Co.
K not in the charge three were detailed, three were in
the rear, footsore, barefoot or sick, and one—E. Hearn—had
accidentally shot himself through the hand. A singular
fatality followed the members of the Brown family
in Co. K. There were three brothers—A. Pinkney, Elnathan
and C. Wesley Brown—and a brother-in-law, J.
A. Fergerson. The first two died of disease, and the
last two were killed in battle. All were good men and
brave, reliable soldiers. A fourth brother—Richard—who
belonged to another command, lost an arm in battle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
The loss in the regiment was about 150 out of 300 engaged.
The color-guard were all killed or wounded.
Lieut. Crymes, of Co. I, went over the entrenchments,
and, refusing to surrender, was shot dead while waving
his sword and calling to his men to follow. Maj. Knox
was mortally wounded, Capt. Williams was taken prisoner,
and the command of the remnant of the regiment
devolved upon Lieut. McRae.</p>

<p>Corp. Rice collected together, on the morning after the
battle, six men of Co. K, viz.: Privates T. M. Boggan,
Day, A. D. Ellis, Killough, Martin and John Tunnell,
and proceeded with the regiment to Nashville, where,
some days later, O. Sergt. Alexander and private Moncrief
rejoined the command.</p>

<p>Companies C and K were now united, and Orderly-Sergt.
Alexander, of Co. K, was placed in command;
Sergt. Blaylock, of Co. C, being second. The weather
was extremely cold, and as nearly all the remnant of Co.
K were barefoot and thinly clad, they suffered severely.</p>

<p>On December 15th, the first day of the battle of Nashville,
Stewart’s corps occupied the left of Hood’s army.
The First Alabama was stationed on the left flank of the
corps, at right angles to the main line, behind a stone
wall on the Hillsboro’ pike. In response to a call for
sharpshooters, Sergt. Alexander detailed T. M. Boggan,
Killough and Moncrief to go to an outlying redoubt on
the extreme left. The ground was covered with snow
and ice. Late in the evening the enemy advanced in
two heavy lines on the left, and, overlapping the Confederates,
captured the redoubt, and appeared in the rear
of the stonewall. The First had up to this time successfully
held their ground against the attack in front, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
now had to fall back, a considerable number being captured.
Of Co. K, Moncrief was captured in the redoubt,
and Sergt. Alexander, Corp. Rice and Private A. D.
Ellis at the stonewall. T. M. Boggan, in attempting to
leave the redoubt, was seriously wounded in the thigh
and captured; he recovered from his wounds, and remained
at Camp Chase till the war closed. Day,
Killough, Martin and John Tunnell succeeded in escaping.
The “First” was hotly engaged again on the 16th,
and in the two days lost some 75 killed, wounded and
prisoners.</p>

<p>The retreat from Tennessee abounds with incidents,
but they belong either to the history of the army or to
personal experience. Gen. Walthall commanded the
rear-guard, of which Gen. Obdycke, the Northern officer
who restored Schofield’s broken lines at Franklin, says:—“The
rear-guard remained firm, and did its work
bravely to the last.... Walthall and Forrest
selected one position after another with such unerring
judgment that even Wilson and Wood were unable to
gain any important advantage during a period of twelve
days, and over a distance of 100 miles.” As in the advance,
so in the retreat, the ragged remnant of the First
Alabama was always ready for duty—“faithful even unto
death.”</p>

<p>The following letter from Gen. E. C. Walthall to the
writer testifies to their services:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Grenada</span>, Miss., April 20, 1885.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:—Your letter written to me at Washington
was mislaid but not forgotten. Gen. Quarles’
brigade was with us on the retreat from Nashville, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
the First Alabama Regiment was along. The rear-guard
was composed of eight brigades, but they were all so
small that I temporarily consolidated them in four.
Quarles’ and Featherston’s were put in one, commanded
by Gen. Featherston. The troops all behaved splendidly,
and their services were all of great value.</p>

<p class="center">“Your friend truly,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">E. C. Walthall</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Wounded men got out as best they could, many
hobbling along the frozen pikes on crutches. Among
these were all the members of Co. K wounded at Franklin.
Shoal Creek, a stream swollen at that time to
formidable proportions, seemed at one time to have cut
off the retreat of the cripples, but kind-hearted cavalrymen
carried those across who could not wade. It was
nearly 100 yards wide, with a rocky bottom full of holes.
In one instance, seen by the writer, a mule slipping threw
a cripple into water nearly to his armpits; but the soldier
held on to his crutches, and without assistance finally
hobbled ashore. A cavalryman who had already carried
several over returned, against the remonstrances of his
companions, and took the writer across. The next
morning, Saturday, December 24, the crowd of wounded
men were ferried across the Tennessee in pontoon boats
at a point near Florence, Ala., and were safe.</p>

<p>The First Alabama arrived at Verona, Miss., on January
16, 1865; thence they were ordered to report to
Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, in North Carolina. Six of
Co. K were with the regiment: Corp. Josiah Tunnell,
Privates Griffin, Killough, Martin, Robinson and John
Tunnell. The regiment, numbering about 100 men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
participated in the last two battles of the war, Averysboro
and Bentonville. On the last day of the second battle,
at sundown, Lieut. William Williamson, Co. C, a gallant
Christian gentlemen, was mortally wounded. The First
Alabama was present, and ended its untarnished career
at the surrender of Gen. Johnston’s army at Greensboro’,
N. C., on the 27th of April, 1865. Those of Co. K
present at the surrender arrived at Prattville about the
middle or last of May, but it was about the 1st of July
before all the scattered band got to their homes.</p>

<p>John Killough, John and Josiah Tunnell won the honorable
distinction of being present when the company
was mustered in and when it was disbanded. If the
writer remembers correctly, the first two mentioned were
never absent during the three years of service except
when the main body of the regiment were prisoners of
war or paroled. The last named of the three was also
present except for two brief intervals, during one of
which he was at the hospital, wounded.</p>

<p>Death, wounds, disease and imprisonment—the sad
fortunes of war—kept others from sharing this honor.</p>

<p class="hanging allsmcap">PRISON LIFE DURING THE LAST YEAR OF THE WAR—SEARCHING
THE PRISONERS—STARVATION RATIONS—TRUE
TO THE SOUTH—HOME AGAIN.</p>

</div>

<p>The following extract from a letter written by W. L.
Ellis, Esq., conveys a vivid picture of the treatment of
prisoners by the Federals during the last year of the war.
Mr. Ellis was taken prisoner at Franklin.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I surrendered to the Colonel of the Eighth Tennessee
(U. S.) Regiment, and for kindness shown me by him I
shall always feel very grateful. At midnight his command
withdrew from the breastworks and started for
Nashville, I accompanying him. We reached the hills
near Nashville at daylight and halted for breakfast, of
which I partook—and keenly enjoyed—with the Colonel.
I remained with him till 5, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, Thursday, when, with
60 other prisoners, I was sent into Nashville. When our
guards halted near the capitol, the prisoners asked for
water, which a kind lady offered to bring, but the officer
in charge refused permission. She was very indignant;
but there was no redress, and we could only thank her
heartily for her kind intentions. We were then escorted
to the State prison and locked up for the night. Here a
bit of bread and meat was handed us by a negro. At
daylight we were put on a train for Louisville, where we
arrived late in the evening, and were again locked up in
prison, the negro guards giving each a small piece of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
bread and meat. Saturday morning we crossed the river
and marched to the depot, where rations of baker’s bread
and ham were given us. After living on one meal a day,
this food was very acceptable to the hungry prisoners.
We then took the cars for Indianapolis, where we remained
one hour. The citizens would have treated us
very kindly had it not been for the officer in charge. It
was here that a gentleman quietly informed us that if we
had any currency, to conceal it, for we would be searched.
His advice was, of course, taken by the fortunate few
who had a dollar. The train arrived at Chicago about 1
o’clock Sunday morning, and we were ordered into line
and marched three miles through a heavy snow, and then
put into some old barracks, to remain without fire till the
dawn of day. It was intensely cold, and it seemed impossible
to keep from freezing. At daylight the prisoners
were ordered into line, marched to the prison-gates
of Camp Douglas, halted and ordered to ground and
unstrap knapsacks. After searching them thoroughly,
and throwing out such articles as they chose, they ordered
us to partly undress, that they might search our
clothing for money. The search ended, we marched into
the enclosure and were allotted to barracks. Soon after,
an orderly came in and notified those without blankets to
go with him to the Captain’s office, and he would furnish
them. Only three or four, of whom I was one, went.
While waiting at the office-door my ears froze—it was
so cold. I received a blanket and a pair of shoes.</p>

<p>“On the second day after our arrival, they appointed
one of the prisoners ‘Sergeant of the Barracks,’ his duty
being to call the roll and see that all was kept in proper
order. The barracks were 18×48 feet, and to each were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
allotted 165 men. The prison-yard was said to contain
25 acres, and there were within the enclosure 59 barracks,
1 office and 1 sutler’s store.</p>

<p>“Our rations consisted of two-thirds of a loaf of baker’s
bread, weighing ten ounces, and eight ounces of fresh
beef, except on every tenth day, when we drew pork and
beans. To divide the beans—they were so few—we had
to count them, and the ration of pork amounted to almost
nothing. The men suffered so from hunger that a prisoner
would break the ice, and wash what we called an
outfit—consisting of shirt, pants, drawers and socks—dry,
and fold them ready for use, for five cents, with
which he would buy a bit of bread. Prisoners from
East Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri could get money
from home, and fared sumptuously as compared with
those of us who lived south of the enemy’s line. They
were not permitted to receive the money, but were given
sutler’s tickets, which could be used at the store.</p>

<p>“I formed the acquaintance of two gentlemen, Messrs.
Beel and Black, from Kentucky, who insisted upon my
messing with them, and I fared much better than others,
as my friends procured supplies from the sutler. We
remained together two or three months, when, through
the influence of friends, they were removed into what we
called the ‘loyal barracks.’ There were hundreds of
poor fellows who received nothing but their scanty rations,
which barely kept them alive—in fact, I believe
some died from starvation.</p>

<p>“The system of punishment was barbarous in the extreme.
They had a wooden horse, made similar to a
carpenter’s saw-bench, twenty or twenty-five feet long
and ten or twelve feet high, which they called a ‘Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
mule.’ On this I have seen prisoners, as many as could
be crowded on, remain six and eight hours in the cold
and sleet. It appeared to me they would freeze to death.
Another punishment was to make the offending prisoner
stand in a bending position with his fingers in the snow
as long as they saw fit. In each barracks there was one
guard who appeared to have absolute authority to punish
at will the prisoners under his charge. The barracks in
which I bunked was more fortunate than many. Our
guard was a gentlemanly fellow from Memphis named
Nelson; he never punished a prisoner during my stay.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the treatment we received, we could
not be driven to take the oath, but remained loyal to the
Confederacy, having the utmost confidence in its triumph.
The morning we received the news of the surrender of
Gen. Lee, Gen. Sweet, the commandant of the prison,
ordered us in line and left it to a vote whether we would
have the United States flag hoisted in the prison yard;
only two voted in favor of it. The guards were very
angry and told the prisoners they ought to remain there
always, but the flag was not hoisted. Soon after we received
the news of the surrender of the other Confederate
armies, and the work of paroling the prisoners was begun.
I arrived home on June 18, 1865.”</p>

</div>

<p>This evidence of Mr. Ellis is fully sustained by letters
from Messrs. John C. Hearn and James D. Rice; the latter
writes: “We fared very badly; the rations were very slim
and the treatment was cruel indeed. I have seen many old
men crying for something to eat.” Mr. T. M. Boggan,
who was at Camp Chase writes: “I was treated very well
only our rations were rather short.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>In closing this brief sketch of the services of Co. K,
the author wishes to place on record that this has been a
labor of love. There was not a comrade for whom he
had not the kindliest regard; there was scarcely one to
whom he was not indebted, during the three years, for
some act showing a reciprocal feeling. For any shortcomings
in this history he asks their lenient judgment,
assuring each and every one that naught has been set
down, naught omitted in malice. God bless the survivors
of Co. K! God rest the souls of those whose ashes are
scattered from the Lakes to the Gulf!</p>
